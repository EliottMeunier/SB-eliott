## Créer un bon hook
Protocole : 
1.  Ask yourself, “If someone else wrote my intro, what are the most captivating questions they could pose to make me excited to read this?”
2.  Write those questions down. Even if you lack the answers.
3.  Rank your questions by how much they interest you.
4.  The top questions become your hooks: pose them in your intro, but don't reveal their answers.

Il faut ensuite transformer ces questions en hooks : 
-   Can you build a significant amount of muscle within three months? How do the celebrities playing superheroes do it?**  
      
    Turn this into a hook** → You can build a significant amount of muscle in three months. I’ll walk you through how celebrities do it when preparing for roles.
-   Is it possible to build all that muscle without going to the gym? Can you buy cheap home equipment instead?**  
      
    Turn this into a hook** → You can build that muscle without going to the gym. There’s affordable home equipment that makes this possible.
