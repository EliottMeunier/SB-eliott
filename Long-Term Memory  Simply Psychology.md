## Highlights
- Theoretically, the capacity of long-term memory could be unlimited, the main constraint on recall being accessibility rather than availability. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437416/17455427))
- Long-term memory (LTM) the final stage of the multi-store memory model proposed by the Atkinson-Shiffrin, providing the lasting retention of information and skills. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437416/17455428))
- Long-term memory is not a single store and is divided into two types: explicit (knowing that) and implicit (knowing how). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437416/17455429))
- One of the earliest and most influential distinctions of long-term memory was proposed by Tulving (1972). He proposed a distinction between episodic, semantic and procedural memory.
  Procedural Memory
  Procedural memory is a part of the implicit long-term memory responsible for knowing how to do things, i.e. memory of motor skills.
  It does not involve conscious (i.e. it’s unconscious - automatic) thought and is not declarative. For example, procedural memory would involve knowledge of how to ride a bicycle.
  Semantic Memory
  Semantic memory is a part of the explicit long-term memory responsible for storing information about the world. This includes knowledge about the meaning of words, as well as general knowledge.
  For example, London is the capital of England. It involves conscious thought and is declarative.
  The knowledge that we hold in semantic memory focuses on “knowing that” something is the case (i.e. declarative). For example, we might have a semantic memory for knowing that Paris is the capital of France.
  Episodic Memory
  Episodic memory is a part of the explicit long-term memory responsible for storing information about events (i.e. episodes) that we have experienced in our lives. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437416/17455430))
