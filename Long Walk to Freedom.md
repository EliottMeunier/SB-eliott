## Highlights
- ‘I realized that they could take everything from me except my mind and my heart. They could not take those things. Those things I still had control over. And I decided not to give them away.’ ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CAUHF6U&location=159))
- ‘Tell me the truth. When you were leaving prison after twenty-seven years and walking down that road to freedom, didn’t you hate them all over again?’ And he said, ‘Absolutely I did, because they’d imprisoned me for so long. I was abused. I didn’t get to see my children grow up. I lost my marriage and the best years of my life. I was angry. And I was afraid, because I had not been free in so long. But as I got closer to the car that would take me away, I realized that when I went through that gate, if I still hated them, they would still have me. I wanted to be free. And so I let it go.’ ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CAUHF6U&location=164))
- ‘To make peace with an enemy one must work with that enemy, and that enemy becomes one’s partner.’ ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CAUHF6U&location=169))
- Mandela writes that they had no choice, that ‘the oppressor defines the nature of the struggle.’ ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CAUHF6U&location=171))
- Just as Nelson Mandela grew to understand the inhumanity of apartheid, he also realized what so many people failed to comprehend; that the oppressor is also a prisoner of prejudice and narrow-mindedness, and that the same chains bound all South Africans, no matter their skin color.
