- Without implementation, information just becomes entertainment. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B086PY4W35&location=160))
- No matter what kind of fairy tale we like to tell ourselves about the purpose for our lives, this pattern will tell us the truth about what we’re doing every day and why we’re really doing it. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B086PY4W35&location=198))
- All day, every day, we’re unconsciously running through a cascading matrix of options in life, but regardless of the story we tell ourselves and others, the lives we have today are most likely a product of answering these three basic questions: What do I do so that I don’t feel uncomfortable? What do I do so that I don’t lose time, energy, or money? What do I do so that I don’t look bad? In other words, when we’re running on autopilot, our choices to avoid “danger” can be boiled down to protecting, pleasing, and proving. Protecting — covering our ass, making sure we don’t do anything to feel discomfort or put ourselves at risk. Pleasing — keeping the peace and making sure we don’t rock the boat with regards to the people we care about. Proving — doing what we’ve got do to consistently signal that we belong, that we’re worthy, and that we matter.
