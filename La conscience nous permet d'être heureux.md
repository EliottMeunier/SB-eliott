## La conscience nous permet d'être heureux 
On sait qu'il faut [[Changer sa vision du monde pour être heureux]], et ce changement apparait grâce à la conscience. On peut être malheureux ou heureux d'un même évènement en fonction de ce qu'on met dans notre conscience. 

the control of consciousness determines the quality of life
consciousness has developed the ability to override its genetic instructions and to set its own independent course of action.
The function of consciousness is to represent information about what is happening outside and inside the organism in such a way that it can be evaluated and acted upon by the body.
With consciousness, we can deliberately weigh what the senses tell us, and respond accordingly.
A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness.
one must find ways to order consciousness so as to be in control of feelings and thoughts.
It simply means that certain specific conscious events (sensations, feelings, thoughts, intentions) are occurring, and that we are able to direct their course.
The hungry person is not aware of the level of sugar in his bloodstream; he knows only that there is a bit of information in his consciousness that he has learned to identify as “hunger.”
Once the person is aware that he is hungry, he might very well form the intention of obtaining some food. If he does so, his behavior will be the same as if he were simply obeying a need or drive. But alternatively, he could disregard the pangs of hunger entirely. He might have some stronger and opposite intentions, such as losing weight, or wanting to save money, or fasting for religious reasons.
consciousness can be ordered in terms of different goals and intentions. Each of us has this freedom to control our subjective reality.
