## Le problème les origines et les insertions des muscles
- The places where muscles attach to bones are often classified as being the origin and the insertion of our muscles. The origin is the attachment that is closer to our torso or the center of our body, and the insertion is the attachment that is farther from our center, closer to our fingers, toes, skull, or coccyx. The underlying implication is that the origin is the fixed point and the insertion is the point that moves; however, this is only true for some of our movements. Any time we move our torso through space, we reverse the so-called origin and insertion points. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=909))
