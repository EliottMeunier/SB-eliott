## Le rapport entre matière états de conscience et niveaux de conscience

#### Rappels
According to Vedanta/Vajrayana, there are **three major states** of consciousness, correlated with **three major bodies** (or mass-energy realms), and five major **levels/structures of consciousness.** 

![[Screenshot 2023-02-04 at 12.27.52.png]]

The 3 states are waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The 3 bodies are gross, subtle and causal. The 5 levels/sheaths are the 5 koshas outlined earlier (gross material, emotional-pranic, mental, higher mental, overmental). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdzd1fbvh26dn81ymx01gkf))

#### Mise en situation 
- The relationships, in the average person, are as follows: the waking
  state, which possesses a material consciousness, is correlated with (and
  supported by) a gross body/energy. The dream state—which contains
  (or can contain) the 3 levels of emotional, mental, and higher mental— is supported by a subtle body/energy. And the deep sleep state, which
  contains an overmental consciousness, is supported by a causal body/
  energy. See Table 2. (And note: the states and stages of consciousness
  are UL; the bodies/energies are UR.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdzdvqtgvw90drtxfjqv2r3))

#### Raisonnement qui dit qu'on a tous accès aux 3 states, mais pas à partir des mêmes stages (lunettes vs lieu)
- Start with a few uncontested facts: an infant wakes, dreams, and sleeps
  —in other words, the infant has access to all 3 major states of
  consciousness. But an infant does not have access to all the major
  stages of consciousness (e.g., the infant does not have access to formal
  operational cognition, which emerges or develops during adolescence;
  nor does the infant have access to postconventional morality, nor to
  hypothetical reasoning capacities, nor to the orange meme, nor the
  green meme, and so on. The higher levels, such as manas and vijnana,
  have not yet emerged). 
  So if we look at the contents of an infant’s dream state, what might we
  find? Whatever we find, it will not be contents from the higher stages
  of development: as research has made abundantly clear, the dreams of
  infants and children do not contain formal operational thoughts, nor
  postconventional impulses, nor turquoise visions, and so on. Rather,
  the contents of the various states are provided by the stage(s) of
  development that the person is at. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre1v2fr018pjyqvtdx6a2nx))
- This model allows us to see how an infant can have access to the 3 great states and bodies of gross reality, subtle reality, and causal reality—but  not in any developed fashion that would allow it to permanently master those realms. Permanent realization and mastery demands development and evolution through the actual levels/stages, a development that converts “temporary states” to “permanent traits.” Nonetheless, according to Vedanta/Vajrayana, all of the structures/stages/levels of consciousness—whether we say there are 5 of them, or 7 of them, or 12 of them, or more—are all variations on these 3 great realms of consciousness and their 3 supporting bodies or energies.

#### Pour résumer : 
- Therefore, even an infant human possesses waking, dreaming, and
  sleeping states, as well as correlative gross, subtle, and causal family-
  energies—even though, again, the contents of those consciousness
  states will be supplied by developmental stages, and the genus and
  species of subtle and causal energies will likewise be supplied by the
  specific stages of development (e.g., only as the human develops
  concrete operational and formal operational thinking will the T-1 fields
  begin to light up, etc.). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre3g27yppw9v8yk27sktavh))

### Et 2e partie de note si on entre plus profondément dans le rapport matière conscience

#### Prémisse 
- Complexity of gross form is necessary for the expression or
  manifestation of both higher consciousness and subtler energy. 
  Hypothesis #4 introduces the possibility that the higher forms of
  consciousness and energy (i.e., higher than the gross-family realm) are
  not tied to complexifications of gross form ontologically but rather as
  vehicles of the expression of subtler forms and energies in that gross
  realm itself. In other words, it is not that higher consciousness and
  energies are bound to the complexities of gross form out of ontological
  necessity, but that they need a correspondingly complex form of gross
  matter in order to express or manifest themselves in and through the
  material realm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre2jrrzyd480pbtsr8wnfbt))

#### Raisonnement 
- One, ontologically, during involution—which is also essentially
  the path that is said to occur in the bardo realm of the reincarnating or
  transmigrating entity (see below)—when Spirit first throws itself
  outward, it creates a causal bodymind. The causal bodymind clearly
  exists without either a subtle bodymind or a gross bodymind, since
  neither of them have yet been created. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre2y94rc7zvdxpg0epnxa6c))
- Two, phenomenologically, when you go to sleep each night and begin
  dreaming, the gross bodymind does not exist and you reside primarily
  as a subtle bodymind; likewise, as you pass into dreamless-formless
  sleep, there is no gross or subtle bodymind, only a causal bodymind;
  hence, phenomenologically, the senior bodyminds can exist apart from
  the junior bodyminds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre2ybmff9vayyf8as0nh3wa))
- Three, in certain nonordinary waking states—such as out-of-the-body
  experiences (or “astral travel”)—one exists in a subtle bodymind, not
  merely a gross bodymind. And in formless meditative states, one exists
  in a causal bodymind, not a subtle or gross bodymind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre2ydn401xqvk609hmtbr3p))
- Hypothesis #4, then, involves the suggestion that a subtle
  consciousness, supported by a very real but subtle mass-energy, does
  not itself depend for its essential existence on the gross realm, although
  it does require a specific degree of complexification of gross matter-
  energy in order to manifest in the gross realm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre3314rhaahxqd5805e07by))
- If hypothesis #4 is true,
  then we would have warrant to say that this is why these subtler
  dimensions, although created and existing in potentia during involution,
  cannot actually manifest themselves until evolution in the gross realm
  reaches a required degree of complexification. Increasingly complex
  vehicles are required for increasingly higher realms; when these higher
  realms manifest, they are not apart from the complexification of form,
  but shine through them and by virtue of them: again, even with
  hypothesis #4, we would say that the higher realms are not actually
  above matter, but within matter. The difference with hypothesis #4 is
  that it adds: the higher realms, when they manifest, manifest within
  matter, but in themselves, they can exist without gross-family matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre348j6r3v0fbtbh8vq1e6f))
- Even though these three family-energies
  emerged or manifested only during the course of evolution, by the time
  of human emergence, all three family-energies are therefore intrinsic to
  a human holon. That is, gross family-energies emerged with the Big
  Bang; subtle-family energies emerged with living cells; and causal-
  family energies emerged with triune brains. Because each stage
  transcends-and-includes its predecessors, all three family-energies come
  with a human body (which is, in fact, a conjoining of three bodies). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gre3fj6d1q7bs7z2v3r3sttc))
