## Empêcher le lecteur d'être sceptique 
Il existe 5 types de scepticisme et 5 solutions :

Superficial: This is the skepticism of readers not believing you’ll share things they don’t already know.
Solution: Tease your original insights in your introduction.‍

Irrelevant: Readers don’t believe you’ll cover key points they care about.
Solution: List the points you’ll cover.‍

Sloppy: Readers don’t want to sit through more bad writing.
Solution: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.‍

Implausible: Readers don’t believe you’ll answer your hooks well.
Solution: Include quotes from authorities who agree with you.

Untrustworthy: Readers don’t believe you're qualified to write about this.
Solution: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can't help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they don’t question you further.
