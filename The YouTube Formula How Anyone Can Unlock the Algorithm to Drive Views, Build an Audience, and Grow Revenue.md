# Mes impressions sur le livre
Tout le début du livre est inutile. Il faut commencer au chapitre 5 pour avoir des informations intéressante sur une stratégie pour Youtube. Les exercices sont très intéressants et il faut les faire. 


# Résumé rapide
Le livre nous explique comment optimiser nos vidéos pour donner à Youtube ce qu'il veut pour qu'il puisse recommander notre vidéo à plus de personnes. C'est la Youtube Formula. 


# Les concepts importants

program called Cloud Vision (CV).
LOCATION: 1120

For example, a thumbnail including a close‐up of world‐renowned physicist Stephen Hawking's face is recognized as such in CV, so that video can be “grouped” in the suggested feed along with every other video on YouTube that has been tagged under the Stephen Hawking topic. This is how your videos get discovered and watched.
LOCATION: 1123

Be aware of what is in the frame in every scene of every video you create! It will be detected by the AI and sorted accordingly, because the AI is validating the thumbnail.
LOCATION: 1143

YouTube has an auto‐caption feature now, and the AI reads through the words of the caption to gather data as well.
LOCATION: 1147

The AI is also listening for actual sentence structure and breaking it down into a sentence diagram. This extracts the meaning of what is being said.
LOCATION: 1151

These suggestions could include trending or recent videos from a channel a viewer has already watched. The discovery side includes videos or channels that users with similar viewing patterns have watched and liked.
LOCATION: 1189

A common misconception is that “trending” is synonymous with “popular,” but it's not. Trending topics are broad topics that people are talking about right now all across the Internet.
LOCATION: 1219

The five categories the P‐Score algorithm watches are (1) popularity (based on Watch time), (2) platform (content more frequently watched on large screens like TVs), (3) passion (engagement), (4) protection (content suitability), and (5) production (superior cinematic technique and camera work).
LOCATION: 1645

I want to help you figure out your finish line so we can make a game plan to get there. This is the first step in the YouTube Formula.
LOCATION: 2401

Don't try to game the system like I did for too long in those early Internet days. Think of the viewers as people, real humans living and breathing. YouTube is built to help humans find the videos they want to watch, videos they enjoy and are satisfied with.
LOCATION: 2447

In order to optimize for humans, I recommend that you define your video with a title that has fewer than 60 characters.
LOCATION: 2460

humans respond to storytelling. Your video should have a story arc. It should begin with you delivering on the promise of your title and thumbnail. After that, you need to reengage the viewer and pull them into your content. This is a great time to share the personal touches: your backstory, your beliefs, and other engaging elements. Doing things like sharing your beliefs puts your viewers in a position to decide whether they agree with you. At the end of the video, you again deliver on the promise of the title and thumbnail, proving that they got what they came for, and you tease a follow‐up video to keep them watching longer. Finally, you interact with your viewers and respond to comments.
LOCATION: 2464

Task 1: Write out your finish line (your goal) and put it somewhere you will see it daily. Don't lose sight of why you're creating, especially in the hard times. Task 2: If you have content on YouTube, go to your real‐time analytics and look through your top‐performing videos. Write down the ones that are more than 6 months old that are still bringing in the most traffic in the past 48 hours. Task 3: Plan, create, and upload a video about the same topic as one of those on the list you made.
LOCATION: 2519

Content resonates differently with different audiences.
LOCATION: 2612

Ultimately, people consume content they care about, so figure out who cares about your particular type of content.
LOCATION: 2616

Psychographics break down a person's beliefs, values, attitudes, motivators, lifestyle choices, fears, and vulnerabilities. It's what drives them. It's their goals and aspirations; it's what they are passionate about.
LOCATION: 2668

to start, the Persona Breakdown is a great way to get a feel for your potential viewer. Then as you make data‐driven decisions based on your viewer's traits and behavior, the magic will happen.
LOCATION: 2759

Do this twice, once for a male viewer and once for a female viewer. Task 1: List your viewer persona's demographics: age or generation, gender, income range, education, geographical location, and relationship status. Task 2: List your viewer persona's psychographics: motivators, values, attitudes, lifestyle, fears, and goals. Task 3: List your viewer persona's online behavior: types of media consumed, content consumed for personal interest versus for entertainment, and channels they subscribe to. Task 4: List your viewer persona's offline behavior: buying behavior, habits, hobbies, and where they spend their time offline.
LOCATION: 2766

It's important to note that the Bronies were not our target buyers. They were the focus group who would respond to the video ad naturally. They would create a feedback loop for the campaign: they would find the ad and watch it all the way through, comment on it, and share it. They would create the buzz so those viewers that would buy the product would see the ad. They would kick‐start the campaign and get it to grow.
LOCATION: 2811

So let's get down to business on the how: Go to YouTube and make a list of 20 different channels in the niche that you are interested in. Then go to the first channel's videos and sort by most popular. Watch the most popular videos that were uploaded within the past year. Go to the next channel and do the same thing. You need to write all of this down. Pay attention to what videos are recommended next when you're watching each video. You'll be able to see what is working on YouTube right now.
LOCATION: 2841

Grouping similar channels together helps you see patterns. When you understand similar channels and how their viewers interact with and respond to their content, you are figuring out who your viewer might be.
LOCATION: 2852

After you make your list on YouTube, go search the niche off of YouTube as well. The people who would be interested in your type of content are interested in things elsewhere on the Internet, and you need to understand their behaviors and interests. Reddit is a great place to find communities. You will be surprised about the things your viewers are interested in that you didn't even know existed. Once you have all of this information, you're gearing up to make data‐driven decisions.
LOCATION: 2856

Go back to your list of YouTube channels and click on one, then, again, sort the videos by most popular. Just forget about the older videos on the channel; you want to look at what has been working recently. Choose 6 to 10 videos per channel that have the most views and make notes on titles, thumbnails, video views, likes and dislikes, and video duration. Notice if the creator uses a hook to pull viewers into the content, what the pacing feels like, and how they edited. Ask what similarities you see among different videos and across different channels in your list. Make note of reengagement throughout the video, calls to action, video descriptions, and comments. You are looking for patterns here: patterns in content creation and patterns in the audience's behavior. This practice is all about the response and interaction of the viewer with the content, and to see what is working right now in your niche.
LOCATION: 2868

we realized that Gen X and millennial women are the biggest spenders online, so our target buyer persona was females aged 25 to 45.
LOCATION: 2893

Task 1: Research at least 10 successful creators in your niche. Task 2: Take note of what they have in common. Watch their most successful videos and take note of video creation and editing patterns. Task 3: See if and how they engage with their communities, both in the video comments and on the Community tab. Read the comments on their most popular videos.

LOCATION: 2932

all good videos follow a pattern: they grab your attention with a hook, hold your attention with reengagement strategies, and leave you with a payoff or unexpected surprise at the end, like the great Darth Vader revelation in The Empire Strikes Back.
LOCATION: 3011

You must explain a problem your viewers can relate to, and when you offer a solution, you back it with credibility.
LOCATION: 3148

Task 1: Go back to the list you made in Chapter 12's Action Exercise. Analyze the videos using Figure 13.1 to see if they use a story arc. Identify the hook, reengagement, setup, climax, and the goosh. Task 2: Create your next video using the story arc.
LOCATION: 3194

Four Ws: Who, Where, What, and When.
LOCATION: 3285

data shows that thumbnails perform better with people's faces in them.
LOCATION: 3327

Task 1: Look in your area for other YouTube creators. See if there are any meet‐ups already happening, either online or offline, and ask to join. Task 2: If there aren't any, create your own mastermind group and meet regularly. Task 3: Look at the videos you have released in the last 90 days. Write down your top‐performing videos and analyze each one using the Four Ws. Look for patterns among them. Task 4: Validate your viewer's persona as identified in Chapter 11's Action Exercise. Are they who you thought they were? How are they different?
LOCATION: 3351

the visual cortex of the brain is what processes visual information. There are four areas to the visual cortex called V1, V2, V3, and V4. There are also special areas of the visual cortex that process visual information very quickly. These are called the “preattention” areas because they process information faster. Let me show you how this works.
LOCATION: 3416

The preattention areas of the visual cortex are not the only visual/brain connection we use. Another area of the brain you can tap to grab attention on a thumbnail is the Fusiform Facial Area (FFA). This part of the brain is sensitive to human faces and is close to the area of the brain that processes emotions. This serves as an explicit trigger in thumbnails because the brain has circuits devoted to faces.
LOCATION: 3435

Curiosity earns the click. Your thumbnail and title combination should make someone scrolling through pause long enough to consider clicking.
LOCATION: 3469

To make sure your image draws in the human eye, keep it simple and balanced. A viewer feels more connected to a well‐balanced image because it feels aesthetically right. An image that appears static will always look less interesting. One of the first techniques a beginner photographer learns in a photography class is the “Rule of Thirds.” It's an effective technique to compose a balanced photo by dividing it into thirds, both horizontally and vertically. The subject of the image is positioned at the intersection of those dividing lines or along one of the lines itself. The dividing lines of the Rule of Thirds effectively breaks down an image into nine parts,
LOCATION: 3480

Always ask these questions when taking photos or designing thumbnails: What are the points of focus in this shot? Where do you place that focus in the grid?
LOCATION: 3494

Data has shown that the best thumbnails include an object and a person.
LOCATION: 3558

To do a thumbnail the right way, plan ideas before you even shoot the video. Ask yourself, “How do I explain what's going on without words?” Then go through the thumbnail brainstorm list and come up with ways you could use two or three different methods to design images for this particular video. Often it takes a combination of these tactics to capture viewers. Remember that the more emotion you put in the thumbnail, the more intriguing and clickable it will be. Then do a photo session before shooting the video. Take pictures from different angles, and remember that simplicity sells.
LOCATION: 3622

You should have two or three variations of each thumbnail concept you choose, because you need options to test or to quickly change out if you are not getting a good CTR. Once you've completed the photo shoot and the images are edited and ready to go, you can go through your thumbnail options and ask yourself: Which image is more clickable? Does it actually portray the video content? Does it get the audience excited or intrigued? Would you actually click on that thumbnail?
LOCATION: 3630

Netflix's study told us that once we grab the viewer's attention with the thumbnail, we have 1.8 seconds to make an impression with our titles, so let's not waste it. This can be the difference if someone will be watching your video or moving on to the next thing that grabs their attention.
LOCATION: 3644

You have to consider the subconscious split decision a viewer is making when they look at your thumbnail and then title. In that split second, their brain is asking: Is this video what I'm looking for? Do I really want to watch this video? Is this video going to be worth my time? Whether you like it or not, your YouTube titles help shape the viewer's decision to click.
LOCATION: 3655

Why is the viewer coming to YouTube? Why are they scrolling on the Homepage? Why are they searching videos on YouTube? Why are they watching these videos or not watching those videos? There was a 2017 study called, “The Values of YouTube,” that tried to validate some assumptions about why people come to the platform. I always geek out over any new study Google does relating to YouTube, but geek or not, every YouTuber needs to look at the study shown in Figure 15.9. The YouTube viewer's Why is simple, and it comes down to four things: Entertainment, Education, Inspiration/Motivation, and De‐stress/Relaxation. This is simply human nature.
LOCATION: 3666

The micro level is the What. What do they need to learn? What is the solution to their problem? What would they find entertaining? What will inspire them? What will help them de‐stress or relax? Most importantly, what would encourage them to click? What is your value proposition to get people to click and watch?
LOCATION: 3672

Remember this is about people coming to YouTube to satisfy their Why. The What is the keyword or phrase that will be used in the title to get them to click. This is also the topic of the video. The What is the final trigger that clicks in their brain to actually take action. The right keyword or phrase helps with the decision making process and makes the video more enticing to click on. This is about people, not the algorithm.
LOCATION: 3679

keeping them easy to remember, simple to explain, and easy to share
LOCATION: 3686

Use active voice. Active voice titles are effective on YouTube because they are clear, to the point, and can be easily understood.
LOCATION: 3705

Be relevant, trending, and topical. Using trends and current events helps titles become candy for the right viewer.
LOCATION: 3708

Use questions (both open‐ and closed‐ended). People use YouTube as a search engine and they will ask specific questions.
LOCATION: 3713

Include numbers for listicle video titles. This is by far one of the most powerful title and video strategies because it gives the viewer a clear idea of what to expect, a clear time limit, and helps viewers remember.
LOCATION: 3719

State a problem and offer a solution. Problems always bring in human emotions.
LOCATION: 3723

Create urgency. As humans, we have the fear of missing out, or “FOMO.” You want to be able to offer information that the viewer will want to see right now.
LOCATION: 3727

Use a trusted source. This can help those viewers that need validation to push them over the edge for the click.
LOCATION: 3732

Address the viewer. When you address the viewer in the video title, it makes them more willing to click, because it feels like the video was made for them.
LOCATION: 3734

Use emotional drama or polarizing words: There is a reason why people become curious onlookers at car crashes, fires, and fights.
LOCATION: 3738

Capitalize your titles or words. All titles should capitalize the first letter of each word,
LOCATION: 3743

Amplify with attention‐grabbing words. Amplify the keyword or phrase to take your title over the edge. Use words like: Ultimate, Worst, Best, Faster, Insane, Crazy, WOW, or I Cried.
LOCATION: 3749

Task 1: Using what you learned in this chapter, brainstorm 10 new title ideas for your next video. Narrow it down to three possible titles. Make sure your titles are easy to remember and simple to explain and share. Task 2: Brainstorm three or four possible thumbnail ideas for each title. Use YouTube and Google images to come up with ideas to make the ideas stronger. Pick a thumbnail strategy and sketch it out (don't worry about being an artist). Task 3: Get human feedback on these ideas from your mastermind group.
LOCATION: 3775

The title and thumbnail will get you views, but AVD and AVP will get you Watch time and the right kind of audience.
LOCATION: 3837

Sometimes the bump is subtle, but it's still there. The points of “rise” are where your content is performing well with your audience. Analyze what's going on in that point of the video so you can do more of it. Then look at the “fall” points, and analyze what was going on in your content to make people leave.
LOCATION: 3857

The AVPV is the average number of times a viewer watched any video on your channel
LOCATION: 3870

Look at your endings and outros, too. Keep them short with the goal of getting the viewers to watch another video, preferably yours, fast.
LOCATION: 3884

at the spot where you lost the first 30% of your viewers. It's usually in the first 30 to 60 seconds of the video. Figure out what triggered this drop so you can see how to adjust based on the data.
LOCATION: 3893

Put effort and energy into the edit, and don't be afraid to cut what's not working. Become emotionally detached from your content so you can look at it objectively and it won't make you feel bad when you have to cut something.
LOCATION: 3922

Task 1: Review your three best videos when it comes to AVD and AVP. Task 2: Analyze using the 50% and 30% rules. How would you make your video different knowing what you know now? Task 3: Notice the bumps and drop‐offs in your videos and see if you can find a pattern.
LOCATION: 3954

Collaborations can push traffic that wouldn't have found your channel otherwise.
LOCATION: 4016

What content you're posting and when Which audiences you're targeting Which social channels you're hitting
LOCATION: 4028

always prioritize your strategy for recommendation, since it accounts for three‐quarters of all YouTube traffic.
LOCATION: 4035

Once, I had a client who wrote a list of about 40 of their most frequently asked questions. Forty sounds like a great list, right? Well, to get the most out of this exercise, you have to go way beyond FAQs. So after he had his 40 down, I had him think about every possible question he had ever been asked and had him add them all to his list. He ended up with more than 250 questions.
LOCATION: 4074

Next, I want you to make a list of questions that people should ask you. These are your SAQs, or should ask questions. Your SAQs and FAQs should interweave.
LOCATION: 4081

Task 1: Look at your video library and group similar videos together. Task 2: Label these groups of videos by topic. These have become your buckets. Task 3: Analyze your videos in your buckets using the Four Ws (Chapter 14's Action Exercise). Task 4: Analyze your titles and thumbnails in each bucket by looking for patterns among the ones with the highest CTR and AVD. Task 5: Plan, create, and upload a new video that will fall into one of your buckets.
LOCATION: 4358

When content was built around a loyal community, it consistently performed better than content that wasn't.
LOCATION: 4374

Community is everything. Humans need each other; we yearn to connect in all kinds of ways. We need to feel a sense of belonging. We want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.
LOCATION: 4375

Primal Branding that teaches the fundamentals of community building. It was written by Patrick Hanlon in 2006 and remains relevant through every change in trends and technology to date.
LOCATION: 4391

humans simply want to feel included, recognized, and accepted. We want to belong somewhere, knowing there are people just like us. We need to feel like we are not alone. Communities offer this sense of belonging, but they come with their own set of rules, language, and identities.
LOCATION: 4398

The second fundamental is your Creed. This is your belief system. If your values and principles aren't clear to you, how will they be clear enough that your followers know exactly why they want to belong to your community?
LOCATION: 4452

Icons are any representation of your brand. Patrick's explanation is simple, but perfect: “Icons remind us that we are in this place, not that place.”
LOCATION: 4469

Now that people know how to identify you, they need to know how you operate and what you do. The fourth fundamental in Primal Branding is Rituals. Rituals are your processes, methods, and procedures. Patrick calls Rituals meaning in motion. In colloquial terms, Ritual is “how we roll.” People have seen what you're about, now they need to see how you go about it.
LOCATION: 4497

The fifth fundamental in community building is how the people talk. It's called Sacred Words or Lexicon. Words identify us.
LOCATION: 4515

Patrick's favorite example of Sacred Words is ordering a drink at Starbucks: iced grande skinny vanilla latte. You have to know the words so they get your order right.
LOCATION: 4517

Sixth, what would a community be without the haters. In Primal Branding, they are called Nonbelievers. They are the counterculture to who you are, what you believe in, and what you do.
LOCATION: 4536

The last element in Primal Branding is having a Leader. Someone needs to be the voice of the community. Brands and channels that perform well have a defined Leader.
LOCATION: 4549

When you have covered all the steps and built a loyal community around your content, there should be an organic acquisition of people in that community who take it a step further. These people do more than consume your content; they become superfans. They are basically your fan club president type. They become evangelists, facilitators, and organizers for your brand.
LOCATION: 4574

When you're trying to build a loyal community, don't change who you are, just listen to your people and respond by giving them more of what they connect to.
LOCATION: 4603

Communication in consumerism used to come from the top down: the manufacturer would tell the consumer about the product. But now it's flipped. The consumers are on top and saying “Hey, I have the money; come and find me,” and the brand has to respond in order to get the business.
LOCATION: 4613

Task 1: Using your viewer persona, develop a plan to build a community with your most loyal followers. Ask yourself: How will you engage with your audience monthly? What action steps will your community take each month? Task 2: Recognize and reach out to some of your most loyal followers and ask them to be your channel moderators.
LOCATION: 4634

A word of warning here, do not reuse the exact same description over and over; the algorithm doesn't like it.
LOCATION: 4708

I also use a feature on endscreens called “best for viewer” that lets the algorithm choose a video from my library that it thinks that particular viewer is likely to watch.
LOCATION: 4713

promoting with a blended strategy of organic reach and paid push produces the best results. This is true whether your goal is to grow an audience or to sell something.
LOCATION: 4844

like to have data for at least 10 videos so I have enough data to provide a good baseline. To establish your baselines, select a traffic source. Then select 10 videos in that traffic source. So if you did this with Suggested traffic and CTR first, you would get your 10 videos, add those numbers up, and divide by the number of videos. This is your Suggested traffic CTR baseline. (Note: If you've established your video buckets, group your videos by bucket and then find your average.) Repeat this process for the other traffic sources for CTR. Then move on to the next metric and repeat the process of finding its baseline in each traffic source, as you did for CTR.
LOCATION: 4903

Look at your CTR as soon as YouTube gives you that data, generally two to three hours after uploading a new video. This is your real‐time data. If your CTR is below the baseline you've established, your next step is to look at your Impressions data before you change anything. This is super important because if your impressions have gone up, it means the AI is pushing your video to a broader audience. More eyes get the chance to see your thumbnail and title, which is a good thing, so even if this makes your CTR number lower, your video is actually getting seen by more viewers! This is a hard concept for a lot of creators to grasp. Switch your mindset from “Low CTR = Bad,” to “Low CTR = Could be good, let's look a little harder.” If your CTR is low but your Impressions are high, don't change anything yet. Let your content simmer, and see what it does. But if your CTR is low and your Impressions are average or below, it's time to adjust in real time. You need to change a thumbnail or title now. I recommend switching out your thumbnail first because it's what grabs viewers' attention before they look at the title.
LOCATION: 4919

When you can identify patterns, you'll know what to adjust for future content creation.
