## Le monde est une manifestation de l'Esprit
- Whitehead used to speak of two fundamental aspects of Spirit: the Primordial Nature of Spirit (timeless and unchanging: our “Emptiness”) and the Consequent Nature of Spirit (the sum total of the results or products of Spirit-in-action or Eros or evolution, as they ceaselessly, with novelty and creativity, emerge in the ongoing stream of Becoming).

- The world that we are aware of—in either the pure Witness state or the ultimate nondual Unity state—is a world where every single thing and event that arises is a perfect manifestation of the Divine, of Spirit, of the Great Perfection.

- Like any painting, there are light areas and dark areas, hills and valleys, highs and lows, brights and dulls, areas that are conventionally judged “good” and areas that appear “bad”—pleasure and pain, good and evil, better and worse, higher and lower—but the point is, all of them are necessary, are required, in order for the Total Painting to exist at all. If we got rid of all dark areas, shades, and shadows, the Painting would simply cease to exist—it would just be areas of pure white and all light, looking rather like a snowstorm in the Arctic, with no discernible features at all. Rather, every single thing and event that is arising is an intrinsic, necessary part of this great, vast, Total Painting of All That Is.
