## Les 3 ressources pour faire face au stress
1. Structures sociales
2. Ressources internes/psychologiques (introverti vs extraverti)
3. Strat√©gies de secours (r√©silience, etc.)

In trying to sort out what accounts for a person‚Äôs ability to cope with stress, it is useful to distinguish three different kinds of resources. The first is the external support available, and especially the network of social supports. A major illness, for instance, will be mitigated to a certain extent if one has good insurance and a loving family. The second bulwark against stress includes a person‚Äôs psychological resources, such as intelligence, education, and relevant personality factors. Moving to a new city and having to establish new friendships will be more stressful to an introvert than to an extrovert. And finally, the third type of resource refers to the coping strategies that a person uses to confront the stress.

COPE STRATEGIES : 
==There are basically two ways to cope with a situation that creates psychic entropy. One is to focus attention on the obstacles to achieving one‚Äôs goals and then to move them out of the way, thereby restoring harmony in consciousness. This is the direct approach. The other is to focus on the entire situation, including oneself, to discover whether alternative goals may not be more appropriate, and thus different solutions possible.==


The ability to take misfortune and make something good come of it is a very rare gift. Those who possess it are called ‚Äúsurvivors,‚Äù and are said to have ‚Äúresilience,‚Äù or ‚Äúcourage.‚Äù

**The integrity of the self depends on the ability to take neutral or destructive events and turn them into positive ones.** Getting fired could be a godsend, if one took the opportunity to find something else to do that was more in tune with one‚Äôs desires.

It is for this reason that courage, resilience, perseverance, mature defense, or transformational coping‚Äîthe dissipative structures of the mind‚Äîare so essential. Without them we would be constantly suffering through the random bombardment of stray psychological meteorites.

Why are some people weakened by stress, while others gain strength from it? Basically the answer is simple: those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and emerge stronger from the ordeal.

They did not doubt their own resources would be sufficient to allow them to determine their fate.
