## Les 5 états de l'esprit 
- Your mind can be in five different states. It could be inert—meaning, it is not activated at all; it is in a rudimentary state. If you energize it, it becomes active but scattered. If you energize it further, it is no longer scattered, but starts oscillating. If you energize it further, it becomes one-pointed. If you energize it still further, it will become conscious. And if your mind is conscious, it is magic; it is a miracle; it is a bridge to the beyond. ([Location 2406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=2406))
- Eventually, once your thoughts, emotions, body, and energy are channeled in one direction, your ability to create and manifest what you want is incredible. ([Location 2430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=2430))
