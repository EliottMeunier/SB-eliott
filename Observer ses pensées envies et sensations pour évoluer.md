## Observer ses pensées envies et sensations pour évoluer 
Énormément détaillé également dans [[3 GARDEN/Notes/Inner Engineering]] ou encore [[Technique Vipassana]]

### Exemple avec une envie passagère 
- So particularly the next time hunger arises (whether you’re overweight or not), truly give it attention, give it mindfulness awareness. This is just like videotaping something: you’re a perfectly neutral camera, seeing everything just as it is without any judgment—you don’t want to criticize it, condemn it, or identify with it; simply be aware of it neutrally, and pervasively, from all angles. Where is this hunger desire located (head, mouth, heart, stomach, gut, hands, feet)? What color is it (just whatever comes to mind)? What shape is it (also, whatever comes to mind)? What does it smell like (whatever comes to mind)? Really feel the primitiveness and urgency, the driven-ness of this drive. Stay with that yearning urgency. Make that subjective drive an object of mindfulness, an object of awareness. Really look at it, long and steady. Feel it directly, with feeling-awareness, which can be seen as another term for “mindfulness.” ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BMYXTU0&location=438))

### Comment sortir du orange
- In mindfulness sessions, as we’ll continue to see, you’ll want to focus intently on the feeling of, in this case, being incredibly special. See yourself as world famous: walking the red carpet at the Cannes Festival, with numerous media photographing you, critics all praising you, fans screaming out for you. Hold that feeling of pure fame—just unflinchingly feel it, see it, look at it, just as if you were videotaping it—not judging it, condemning it, or identifying with it, just meeting it with pure awareness. Make it an object instead of a subject or a self, thus clearing the slate for a new and higher level of self and awareness to emerge. Seeing the hidden map means you have converted it into an object of awareness, you’ve made it “un-hidden,” and so it stops governing your behavior, making room for higher maps that are more accurate and more adequate.

- - (And we note, of course, that absolutely every individual is genuinely special, is a perfect manifestation of the Divine, of the Great Perfection, exactly as they are. We are here talking about infantile forms of specialness, narcissistic and self-centric or egocentric forms, where one’s own specialness depends on seeing others as lacking in this specialness—which only I possess!—whereas a mature specialness sees all sentient beings as inherently possessing the Great Perfection, a Kosmocentric—not egocentric—specialness. But in order to make room for that Kosmocentric specialness, we have to uproot any hidden maps stuck on egocentric specialness—which is exactly what mindfulness will do, and what we are focusing on doing right now.)

- So, hold any of these magical, superstitious beliefs directly in awareness; see them straightforwardly, neutrally, without criticizing, blaming, or identifying—pure videotaping. “Transcend and include” them: become aware of them, thus “transcending” them, making them an object instead of subject, forcing a dis-identification with them (i.e., seeing them as an object of awareness tears them away from being a subject of awareness, from being a self, from being an attachment, fixation, or addiction).
