## Les articulations et leur fonction
Anatomie d'une articulation : 
![[IMG_0585.jpg]]

- When our joint space is not balanced through the full range of movement and force is not distributed across the articulating surfaces, wear and tear on the hyaline cartilage occurs. Like other tissues in our body, our hyaline cartilage constantly remodels itself and can repair minor wear and tear without long-term consequences. (There are other tissues in our body, such as muscles, that remodel at a faster rate than our hyaline cartilage.) If the imbalance in our joint space is consistent and continuous over a long period of time, our hyaline cartilage cannot repair itself and can eventually become damaged or worn away. If our hyaline cartilage is worn away, the ends of our bones rub against each other. This friction eventually stimulates our bones to grow unevenly, which causes more friction and stress on the bones. This cycle of friction and growth can become quite painful and is one cause of osteoarthritis. ([LocationÂ 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=496))
