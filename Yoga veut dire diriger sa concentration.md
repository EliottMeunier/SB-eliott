## Yoga veut dire diriger sa concentration 
- The word Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj meaning to bind, join, attach and yoke, to direct and concentrate one’s attention on, to use and apply. It also means union or communion. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=221))
