# Les concepts clés 
## Recette universelle : 
Créer sur Internet suit un processus très simple en trois étapes. 

- Étape 1 : De quel "type" de contenu s'agit-il ?
	- Forme n°1 : Guide pratique 
	- Forme n°2 : Opinion 
	- Forme n°3 : Liste de ressources
	- Forme n°4 : Histoire 
	- Forme n°5 : Je donne mes conseils en tant que personne crédible et compétente

- Étape 2 : Quelle "idée" est-ce que je communique dans ce contenu ?
	- Idée n°1 : Explication (quand/où/comment quelque chose se passe)
	- Idée n°2 : Habitudes (pour atteindre une destination, un objectif ou un état d'esprit) 
	- Idée n°3 : Erreurs (qui vous empêchent d'atteindre une destination, un objectif) 
	- Idée n°4 : Leçons (apprises dans la poursuite d'une destination, d'un but) 
	- Idée n°5 : Conseils (qui peuvent vous aider dans votre propre quête d'une destination, d'un but) 
	- Idée n°6 : Histoires (qui symbolisent ou expliquent un aspect de la poursuite d'une destination, d'un but) 
	- Idée n°7 : Événements précis (qui sont pertinents pour la connaissance, la conscience ou la poursuite d'une destination, d'un but par le lecteur cible).

- Étape 3 : Pourquoi moi ? 
	- Crédibilité n°1 : "Je suis un expert sur ce sujet. Voici ce que je pense". 
	- Crédibilité n°2 : "J'ai consulté tous les experts de confiance sur ce sujet. Voici toutes leurs idées et opinions en un seul endroit." 
	- Crédibilité n°3 : "Je ne fais que partager mon opinion, mais mon opinion est la plus articulée de toutes." 

Lorsque vous combinez ces trois étapes ensemble, vous obtenez soudainement une équation très facile (et reproductible) pour rédiger de manière constante un contenu de haute qualité et très performant. 

Par exemple : 
- Liste sélectionnée x erreurs x 7 experts du secteur (crédibilité n°2) = "7 fondateurs partagent les plus grosses erreurs qu'ils ont commises en levant des fonds pour leurs premières startups". 
- Crédibilité x Explication (pourquoi) x Expert (Crédibilité n° 1) =  "J'étais un joueur professionnel de World Of Warcraft à l'adolescence. Voici pourquoi l'eSport va devenir une industrie de plusieurs milliards de dollars". 
- Opinion x Leçons x Mon point de vue (Crédibilité n° 3) = "L'économie de notre pays s'effondre. Voici à quoi cela ressemble pour quelqu'un qui vit dans un quartier à faibles revenus".

# Créer une liste de sujets principaux

Étape 1 : Dressez la liste de vos 3 catégories de contenu. Chacune d'entre elles correspond aux catégories que vous cherchez à cibler à long terme. 
- Public général (exemple : Productivité) 
- Public de niche (exemple : Créateurs de contenu, entrepreneurs) 
- Entreprise/secteur (exemple : Creator Economy) 

Étape 2 : Dans chaque catégorie, identifiez quelques sujets généraux sur lesquels vous voulez devenir une "voix influente". 
- Public général (exemple : la productivité) 
	- Conseils de productivité 
	- Techniques de gestion du temps 
	- Informations sur la productivité
- Public de niche (exemple : créateur de contenu) 
	- Avoir des idées 
	- Créer un bon contenu
	- Gérer son temps en tant qu'entrepreneur
- Entreprise/Industrie (exemple : Creator Economy) 
	- Les tendances de la nouvelle économie
	- Les nouveaux métiers de l'économie de l'attention
	- Les compétences à développer 

Étape 3 : Ensuite, sous chaque public, puis sous chaque sujet, utilisez la recette universelle pour trouver des centaines de titres de contenus.

Public général (exemple : Productivité) 

Conseils de productivité :
- COMMENT être plus productif ?
- Comment les entrepreneurs de startups, les athlètes professionnels et les milliardaires restent productifs ?
- Comment tout le monde peut être plus productif avec ces X petits changements dans sa routine matinale ?
- Comment trouver un équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée sans se faire licencier ? 

Techniques de gestion du temps :
- X moyens peu connus de se rendre plus productif au quotidien 
- X moyens peu conventionnels qui font la productivité de <insérer une personne de haut niveau>
- X moyens uniques pour accomplir plus de travail en 5 fois moins de temps 
- X logiciels peu coûteux qui vous aideront à être plus productifs 

Information sur la productivité
- Le programme d'entraînement de Michael Jordan peut nous apprendre des choses sur la productivité

**Convenience** : You didn’t want to go scrolling through my library of 3,000+ articles to find the ones about writing. Buying this book and having all those insights here was easier (I saved you time). 
**Specificity** : You didn’t want to piece together handfuls of takeaways from all my free content. You wanted an entire resource dedicated to one specific topic: how to write online. 
**Depth**: You didn’t just want to read an 800-word article on the topic of online writing that barely skimmed the surface. You wanted 200+ pages, and you wanted examples, and you wanted stories, and you wanted to feel like if you went down this rabbit hole and made it all the way through this book, you’d emerge 100x more knowledgeable and prepared for success.

**There are 2 types of writers today: those who use data to inform and improve their writing, and those who fail.** ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=573))


## Highlights en vrac

They think they know who their audience is. They think they know what book they should write. They think they know which part of their story is going to resonate with the most people. They think they know “who they are”—and the brutal truth is, they don’t. They have assumptions. They have educated guesses. But they have zero data that can confirm whether or not they’re correct. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=607))

Likes = “This is something I approve of. Nice job.” Shares = “This is something more people need to know about. This represents me.” Comments = “This is thought provoking. I agree/disagree, and I want you to know why. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=636))
Views = “This strikes a chord. There’s something valuable here.” ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=639))

But the truth is, the real reason most people aren’t successful writing online has very little to do with all the bells and whistles that surround the writing. Their biggest problem is the writing itself. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=707))
I would just like to point out that whether we like it or not, we are all playing “the game” as long as we’re on the internet. Which means, Level 1 is all about answering the question, “Am I playing this game consciously? Am I achieving my goal? Or am I playing this game unconsciously, and do I not care where I end up?” ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=723))
Successful writers play the game of Online Writing consciously. Unsuccessful writers play the game unconsciously—and then wonder why they aren’t succeeding. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=727))
A category is a frame, a bucket, a spot on the shelf where similar objects reside. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=753))
It isn’t until the individual is within a category that they ask themselves, “Who is the single best writer in this category? ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=758))
Categories are how we organize information in our minds. Know your category and you’ll know where readers “fit” you into their own minds. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=762))
All writing exists on a spectrum, and that spectrum looks something like this. Educating <<<>>> Entertaining On the left-hand side you have writing that informs and explains (textbooks, news, nonfiction, etc.) and on the right-hand side you have writing that captivates and entertains (true stories, fiction stories, etc.). ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=776))
the real reason it “wins” is because its Rate of Revelation is so much higher. Every single sentence advances the “story” to the next main point. And on the internet, this level of velocity is crucial to hooking and keeping a reader’s attention. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=858))
Once you decide to play the online writing game consciously… Once you know what category you’re competing in… Once you see where your style sits on the Writing Spectrum… Once you become aware of your Rate of Revelation… The only thing left to do is be the most specific writer in your chosen category. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=864))
Other signals of Implied Credibility are: Profile picture: Right out the gate, if your profile picture is blurry and half-hearted, what you’re really telling readers is that you’re not “playing the game” seriously—so then why should they take you seriously? Bio: “I like cats, coffee, and watching Netflix,” is not an effective bio. Instead of trying to be clever, tell people who you are, what category your writing is in, and what makes you “credible.” Production quality: If you post pictures, graphic designs, or videos within your writing, then the quality of these content types are going to speak for you. Low-quality images, for example, are going to tell readers you’re operating on a shoestring budget. High-quality images, on the other hand, lead readers to believe you have the means to hire a professional photographer (which means, “This person must be successful.”). It’s implied. Grammar: There is no faster way to lose credibility with a reader than to have writing littered with mistakes. (However, I too was once a 17-year-old blogger who didn’t know the difference between ‘their’ and ‘they’re.’) So while grammar mistakes can be an issue, don’t let fear keep you from making progress as a writer. Just keep getting better as you go along. Organization of thought: If your writing reads smoothly, a reader is going to assume “you know what you’re doing.” If it’s formatted well, they’re going to assume “you’ve been writing for a while.” These are subtle signals of credibility in the form of expertise. Specificity: Remember, Specificity Is The Secret. The more specific you are, the more likely a reader is going to immediately assume they are in the right place, reading the right writer for them. This is what makes the “game” of online writing so fun. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=956))
Other signals of Perceived Credibility are: What credible people have to say about your writing: “Nicolas Cole is the single greatest writer of this generation.” –Abraham Lincoln Which major publications your writing has appeared in: “Featured in TIME, Forbes, Fortune, Business Insider, and many more.” How many followers you have on social media: 100,000 followers sends a signal you simply cannot send with 100 followers. High barrier-to-entry products: Writing a book, or launching a high-production video course, are signals of credibility simply because they typically either require a significant amount of expertise and/or money in order to execute. Badges and achievements: #1 best-selling author on Amazon, New York Times best-selling author, WSJ best-selling author, Top Writer on Quora, Top Writer on Medium, LinkedIn Influencer, Verified on Instagram or Twitter, etc. These are all examples of badges and achievements that can be leveraged for Perceived Credibility. How much money you’ve made from your craft: Mystery novelist James Patterson is “The world’s best-selling author. His total income over the past decade is estimated at $700 million.” That’s Perceived Credibility on a completely different level. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=986))
Other signals of Earned Credibility are: How long you’ve been creating content for: “Every day for 3 years” sends a very different signal than “I just started last week.” How often you create content: “I write something new every day” vs “I write something every few months, when I feel like it.” How much content you’ve created: “I have written more than 3,000 articles online” vs “I’ve written three blog posts.” How many people consume your content: “I have more than 1,000,000 views on my writing” vs “I have 300 views on my writing.” How well one of your pieces of content has performed: If one of your articles has thousands of Upvotes, Views, etc., that in itself is a badge of credibility—and clear proof what you have to say is valuable. What’s ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1026))
DIFFERENT always beats “Better.” ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1109))
match different audiences, genres, and writing styles to create a new and DIFFERENT category. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1114))
If your goal is to be a successful writer, then social platforms are for publishing first, and consuming second. I have a rule I live by, and it goes like this: “The number of hours I spend consuming should never equal or exceed the number of hours I spend creating.” One of ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1526))
Audience Hacking means collaborating with another writer who has a similar audience to you—introducing your audience to them and their audience to you. ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1734))
This was a very common tactic nearly every top contributing writer used at Inc Magazine. We would all set Google Alerts for companies and public figures that aligned with our respective columns, and we’d wait for them to be mentioned in the news. ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1762))
Delete your original post, change a variable or two, and publish it again. When you publish something to the internet, there are a million variables that dictate whether or not that piece successfully catches fire. ([Location 1825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1825))
Build syndication relationships with websites and major publications, and get around the “duplicate content” rule. “Syndication” is when major publications build partnerships with each other to share popular content. ([Location 1842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1842))
There are five types of writing on the internet. Form #1: Actionable Guide Form #2: Opinion Form #3: Curated List Form #4: Story Form #5: Credible Talking Head ([Location 1952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1952))
The way you “win” the game of online writing is by creating the single best possible version of whatever form of writing you’re using in your chosen category. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1961))
What makes a great headline is getting someone to understand three things at the exact same time: What this piece of writing is about Who this piece of writing is for The PROMISE: the problem that will be solved, and/or the solution being offered ([Location 2161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2161))
Big Ideas From Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, And Jeff Bezos That Changed The World Forever” is more specific. If you’re interested in creativity and business, you know this article was written for you. “This 1 Big Idea Will Change The Way You Think About College” is a big PROMISE. This headline tells the reader, “The way you think about college will no longer be the same after you read this article.” ([Location 2175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2175))
Nonfiction Examples “Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way To Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones” “The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, And Join The New Rich” “Play Bigger: How Pirates, Dreamers, And Innovators Create And Dominate Markets” ([Location 2200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2200))
“7 Tips For Becoming Smarter” is clear, but a bigger PROMISE can help it reach more people. “7 Tips For Becoming Smarter, Achieving Chess-Master Memory, And Becoming The Most Interesting Person In The Room” ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2272))
Here are some of the most proven headline formats in online writing: Big Numbers: For example, “3,000 People Just Filed For Unemployment In This Small Town In Arkansas. Here’s Why.” This is a great headline because “3,000 People” is concrete, definitive, easy to imagine, and yet an unexpectedly large number—and what’s unexpected is exciting. Dollar Signs: Money is about as universal as a topic can get. “$400 Million Is How Much You Need To Make In Order To Afford This Insane Mansion In Malibu” is eye-catching because very few people have $400 million. Dollar signs make the Curiosity Gap wider and more interesting for readers. Credible Names: Celebrities, CEOs, pop culture icons, anyone the world can easily recognize by name is a great way to hook readers’ attention. “Will Smith’s Advice On How To Live A Fulfilling Life Will Change The Way You See The World Forever” is a headline built on credibility. Yes, there’s a great PROMISE here, but the real “hook” comes from the fact that it’s advice from Will Smith. “Amazon, Apple, Tesla, And 4 Other Stocks That Have Made Early Investors Mega-Millionaires” is another example of how to leverage name credibility. “This Just Happened”: Timeliness is a terrific mechanism for getting readers’ attention right now. Words like “Just, Recently, Today, Now,” etc., are what tell a reader that of all the things on the internet to read, “this thing” is high priority. For example, “Michael Jordan Just Gave A Press Conference And NBA Executives Are Furious.” The reason you would want to read that article is to feel in-the-know. The Success Story: These headlines summarize an amazing event or rare occurrence that doesn’t happen every day. For example, “How This Small Team Managed To Secure A Six-Figure Investment In Less Than 1 Week” or “This 1 Group Activity Exercise Increased An Entire Office’s Productivity By 150%.” Things That Shouldn’t Go Together: Combining two or more things in a headline that don’t typically sit next to each other is a great way to force readers to pause and take an interest. For example, “7 Things KFC And Miley Cyrus Have In Common,” or, “What Jay-Z, Pablo Escobar, And Oprah Can Teach Us About Leadership.” For The Industry: These headlines work well when you’re writing for a very specific audience. So much so, that you want to call them out right in the title. The more specific you can be about who the piece is for, the better. For example, “3 Things All Successful Small Business Owners Do To Stay Profitable.” The Topic Within The Topic: Some headlines benefit from a bit of added curiosity. This is a technique that can be applied to any of the other headline structures, and can be a great way of making readers feel like they’re getting the “inside scoop.” For example, “7 Ways The Real Estate Industry Is Changing (And How You Should Be Investing Your Money).” The first part of the headline is strong, but it’s the second part of the headline (inside parentheses) that gives the first part more… ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2340))
In 1/3/1, you have one strong opening sentence, three description sentences, and then one conclusion sentence. Visually, this is a powerful way to tell the reader you aren’t going to make them suffer through big blocks of text, and that you have their best interests in mind. Here’s how it works: This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your conclusion. This fifth sentence is your strong conclusion. ([Location 2461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2461))
The types of introduction structures that work well are: 1/3/1 1/5/1 1/3/2/1 1/5/2/1 1/4/1/1 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 1/3/Subhead/3/1 1/3/1 + Bulleted List 1 + Subhead ([Location 2675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2675))
Smart people read (a lot). Smart people hang around other smart people. Smart people love making mistakes. Smart people see value in all types of knowledge. Smart people work (very, very) hard. ([Location 2702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2702))
This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. And this third sentence is why the reader should care. This fourth sentence starts to expand on the point. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort of credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence builds on that story or insight and tells the reader something they maybe didn’t know. This seventh sentence is a small conclusion. And this eighth sentence is why that conclusion matters. This ninth sentence recaps what you just told the reader. This tenth sentence reinforces the argument you’re making with an additional tidbit or insight. And this eleventh sentence drives the point home. This twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the important takeaway. ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2718))
This first sentence is your opener. This second sentence clarifies your opener. And this third sentence is why the reader should care. This fourth sentence is your mini conclusion. This fifth sentence is why that mini conclusion matters specifically to your target reader. ([Location 2774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2774))
First, you never want to have three or more long paragraphs one after another. That style of writing has been dead for years, and anyone writing that way on the internet is clinging to a way things were but no longer are. Second, if you are going to have long paragraphs one after another, you want to find ways to change up their internal rhythm so they don’t feel or sound exactly the same. One way of doing this is by using punctuation. Have one paragraph with a lot of short, strong sentences. Have the next paragraph be one long, winding sentence. This is what makes them seem “different.” Lastly, notice how before and after both long paragraphs in the above excerpt there are single, declarative sentences. This is very intentional. Again, you want to subtly tell the reader, “I’m going to tell you a quick story—this will only take a second,” before giving them their next mile marker. There’s something about reading a single sentence after a long paragraph that gives a reader the same feeling a listener gets hearing a chord resolve on the piano. Let ([Location 2942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=2942))
Self-promotion on the internet follows the rule of opposites. The more you promote yourself, the less people listen. The less you promote yourself, the more people listen. ([Location 3243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3243))
If I tell you I am a 4x Top Writer on Quora with tens of millions of views on my writing, and that’s the only thing I tell you, then I seem like a self-centered egomaniac. But if I tell you I’m a 4x Top Writer on Quora with tens of millions of views on my writing, and I want to tell you how you can become a Top Writer with tens of millions of views on your own writing too, suddenly I don’t seem self-promotional. I’m just letting you know where my insights are coming from, and that I’m a credible source of information. ([Location 3265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3265))
The Golden Intersection of great writing is: Answering The Reader’s Question x Telling Them An Entertaining Story ([Location 3276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3276))
In the game of Online Writing, volume wins. ([Location 3471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3471))
The three types of “content buckets” I recommend are: General Audience: You should have one bucket that is aimed at universal topics. Things like positive habits, life lessons, productivity topics, etc., are big, broad categories that resonate with the widest number of people. How you make them relevant to you is by approaching them through your own specific lens. Let’s say you’re the VP of Marketing at a software company. You should write about life lessons learned as the VP of Marketing at a software company, or time management techniques you use day in and day out as The VP of Marketing at a software company. This same logic applies no matter who you are. You could be a poet, a foodie, or a master salesman, and there is still massive benefit in targeting universal topics through your own specific lens. Niche Audience: Your second content bucket should be hyper-relevant to your expertise. If you’re the VP of Marketing, then your niche audience would be “marketers”—and refined further, maybe “content marketers.” When speaking to this audience, you have the option of continuing to leverage universal topics to broaden your reach, or intentionally excluding general audiences by speaking directly to the intimate pain points your target reader is experiencing. My recommendation is to do both. Company/Industry Audience: Your third content bucket is the environment and industry you exist within. If you’re a violinist, you should be writing about the violin industry. If you’re a music producer, you should be writing about the music production industry. If you own a SaaS business, you should be writing about software as a service and the SaaS industry at large. If you are a writer, you should be writing about writing (in your specific genre). This third bucket is usually the easiest to pinpoint, however it’s an important one to add into the mix in order to be “seen” as a leader in your chosen category ([Location 3525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3525))
For example, here are my three content buckets: General Audience: Life advice, personal development, and self-mastery as it relates to my own life experiences as a writer and entrepreneur (and previously as a bodybuilder and professional gamer). Niche Audience: Online writing advice, self-publishing, and content marketing. Company/Industry Audience: Thought leadership and personal branding, specifically for executives, founders, investors, etc. ([Location 3542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3542))
