## Highlights
- paint moving objects and figures in your imagination. Once you have vividly created an image, be it a conch or some other object from a novel (a sword, ring, piece of characteristic clothing or treasure), do the following:   - Increase and decrease its size. Make it so huge that it presses up against the walls of the room in your Memory Palace (crack the walls if you like). - Next, make that image so small that it practically disappears. - Spend time working on the speed of the transformation from big to small. Focus on actually seeing the object change sizes. - Spin the object in space - left, right, in every possible direction. Spend time seeing every detail of the object in your mind from every perspective. - Mentally push the object around the room, both forwards and backwards. - Shine light on the object. Reduce the light around the object, again experimenting with the speed at which you imagine the transformations. - Change the colors of the object. Change the outer colors by working with the surface of the object, but also the inner glow. Work with all the colors you can think of, and for bonus points, study a color wheel to become more educated about color combinations.

- Ebbinghaus suggests that learning and retention degrade based on time and position. In other words, the order in which you learn something affects how you will keep it. Thus, the more time you spend on information, or the more “primacy” you give, the greater the chance it will enter long-term memory.
