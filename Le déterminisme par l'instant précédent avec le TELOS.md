## Le déterminisme par l'instant précédent avec le TELOS
- For Alfred North Whitehead, for example, each moment comes to be as a “subject of experience” or a “drop of experience.” And as the new subject comes into being, it “prehends” (his term, which basically means “touches” or “feels”) the previous subject, thus making it object. The prehension, or “touching,” of the previous moment by this present moment constitutes the past’s influence on the present. Obviously, if you touch and embrace an object, that object will affect you—and that’s what happens as each moment touches and embraces (prehends) the previous moment (which itself had touched and embraced its previous moment, and so on indefinitely). This is the “causative” or “determining” moment of the past on the present. If this were all that there was, this would be a purely deterministic, mechanistic universe, with no creativity, novelty, or innovation possible (except for fluke “mutations” or aberrations). But, according to Whitehead (and I agree), each moment, in addition to prehending the previous moment, adds its own bit of novelty or newness or creativity. It not only includes the past, it transcends it. It not only prehends the previous subject (making it object of the new subject), it adds a bit of emergent novelty to the new subject, thus introducing a measure of freedom and newness into the sequence. Now, if the holons thus unfolding have very little depth (such as atoms), then the degree of novelty they can add is very small, and their temporal unfolding will appear very much deterministic, or ruled by strict cause-and-effect. But, Whitehead adds, “little novelty” is not the same as “no novelty.” After all, atoms managed to give rise, eventually, to molecules, a very creative advance indeed. And molecules managed an astonishing leap of creativity—at one point, dozens of very complex molecules managed to find themselves in the same vicinity; they joined together, a cell wall dropped around them, and out of their own inherent creative drive, life appeared! An actual living cell out of molecules! The point is that creative novelty is built into the very fabric of the universe—and that creative novelty is what ultimately drives evolution (this creative drive has been known as everything from “self-organization” to “Eros” to “Love” to “Spirit-in-action”). This is why evolution was already operating beginning with the Big Bang itself and moving forward—it did not have to wait for the emergence of life, sexuality, nucleic acids, random mutations, and natural selection in order to get started. Those were just some particular stages in this ongoing transcend-and-include, or “self-transcendence through self-organization,” which was at the heart of evolution itself all the way back to the very first moments of the Big Bang. (And that is why some people think of evolution as “Spirit-in-action,” which I happen to think is a fine idea.
