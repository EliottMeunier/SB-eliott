## Les 3 types de muscles 
Muscles are divided into three basic types: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. 
- Skeletal muscle is generally attached to bones and creates movement at your joints. It has alternating bands of light and dark fibers that give the tissue its striated appearance.
- Skeletal muscle is controlled by the somatic portion of your nervous system, which makes many of its functions voluntary, or under our conscious control. 
- Cardiac muscle is in your heart, and smooth muscle is in your blood vessels, airways, and visceral organs. Cardiac tissue is also striated but is stimulated by your autonomic nervous system and hormones from your endocrine system. Smooth muscle is not striated and, like cardiac muscle, is stimulated by your autonomic nervous system and your endocrine system.
