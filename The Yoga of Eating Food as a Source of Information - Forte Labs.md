## Highlights
- Eating is a special, even sacred time in which we are literally absorbing new elements into our system. There is tremendous information encoded in that food, from the exact conditions in which the ingredients were grown, to the people who prepared it, to the packaging and processing it underwent to find its way to your plate, to your own physiology and state of mind at the moment you eat it.
  When you chew food slowly, fully absorbing its flavors and textures, you are more attuned to the information it carries. Your need for sensory fulfillment is more easily satisfied, leading you to enjoy simpler food, and less of it.
  When you pay attention to the food you eat, your diet improves not because you exerted more willpower, but because you found the inherent delight contained in simple foods prepared with care. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540409))
- When anonymous strangers grow, process, ship, and prepare our food, is it any wonder we often feel consumed by loneliness and estranged from others? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540420))
- The only principle of the Yoga of Eating is to give your food your full attention:
  Before all meals, observe a brief moment of silence (or if you prefer, say a prayer) to center your attention
  Slow down when eating, reserving a part of your awareness to see that each bite is fully chewed and swallowed
  Every day, take one meal in silence, without distractions of any kind. If this is too difficult, start with 5 minutes of a meal
  At every meal, let the first bite you take from each dish be with perfect attentiveness
  During lulls in the conversation, or when someone else is talking, patiently experience the pleasure of each mouthful ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540423))
- Any diet (or other habit) based solely on willpower is bound to fail. There simply isn’t enough of it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540442))
- There might be seasons of your life that call for a dramatically different diet. If you are going through a major life transition, you might be attracted to very simple plant foods and fasting. If you are building a company or launching a major new project, you might need strong, earthy flavors and proteins.
  Don’t be afraid to let go of a diet that is no longer serving you as your life changes ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540454))
- When we ignore what our body is telling us, we cultivate in ourselves the skill of self-denial. The skill of saying no to what we need. But no matter how skilled we become, those needs don’t go away. They fester and they mutate, emerging in increasingly urgent and obsessive ways.
  The result is an even deeper division, with cravings moving deeper and deeper the longer they are submerged. The tension builds, and the cravings and aversions become more intense. The body speaks its needs louder and louder, even as it does its best with what it has. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540493))
- Shame is the glue that holds unhealthy habits in place. And the opposite of shame is gratitude. Which means that, paradoxically, the moment you can view your body with total gratitude, you are in the best possible place from which to begin making a change. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540495))
- Rather than take away our medicine, we can instead change the conditions that make the medicine necessary. That change is, in fact, constantly happening. It is left to us to simply recognize it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540506))
- Food is an expression of Mother Nature’s unconditional love and generosity. Food is an expression of our appetite for life – the most primitive reminder that the world is good, that the world will provide. We consume too much not because we enjoy food too much, but because we enjoy it too little.
  If you could completely extinguish your desire, it would only be because your desire is weak. Your resistance to external authority is your greatest expression of self-love, defending your essential goodness and wholeness in the face of a world trying to convince you otherwise ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540514))
- If we treat the self as holistic, we see that every part affects every other part. Which means any recurring obstacle in your productivity – a persistent problem with focusing, a tendency to leave things unfinished, difficulty setting boundaries with coworkers – is a symptom of a deeper underlying part of yourself that you haven’t yet learned to accept, understand, and love ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1473121567/18540540))
