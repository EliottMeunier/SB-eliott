# Mes impressions
J'adore l'écriture d'Hermann Hesse, Il a une manière de décrire de simples moments de vie ou des paysages qui nous fait réellement ressentir la volupté immense de ces derniers. Je m'identifie à chaque fois énormément avec ses personnages, comme ce sont de jeunes hommes qui sont en questionnement. Son livre [[Narcisse et Goldmund]] avait énormément résonné avec moi, tout comme celui-là. J'ai lu Siddharta avant et après ma retraite Vipassana ([[Technique Vipassana]]). Je dois avouer que c'était assez magique et le fait de lier les 2 a fait passer ma lecture à un tout autre niveau. 

# Mes citations préférées 

## Le savoir
Le savoir est partout et plus on cherche à le comprendre à l'acquérir, plus on passe à côté car on ne regarde pas là où il se trouve réellement. 
- "We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn. We are not going around in circles, we are moving up, the circle is a spiral, we have already ascended many a level." ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=179))
- There is indeed no such thing, so I believe, as what we refer to as 'learning'. There is, oh my friend, just one knowledge, this is everywhere, this is Atman, this is within me and within you and within every creature. And so I'm starting to believe that this knowledge has no worser enemy than the desire to know it, than learning." ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=194))

**Le craving de trouver dieu, la vérité te fait te perdre dans le processus.**
- "That I know nothing about myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems from one cause, a single cause: I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself! I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing to to dissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the ultimate part. But I have lost myself in the process." ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=399))
- It is true that he had already known for a long time that his self was Atman, in its essence bearing the same eternal characteristics as Brahman. **But never, he had really found this self, because he had wanted to capture it in the net of thought**. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=468))

## L'attraction
Ça me fait penser à [[Les 5 états de l'esprit]], si on dirige nos énergies vitales vers un objectif, rien ne peut nous arriver. 

- Look, Kamala: When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=621))


## Le pouvoir
Le plus tu veux en avoir, le moins tu en as. 

- You don't force him, don't beat him, don't give him orders, because you know that 'soft' is stronger than 'hard', Water stronger than rocks, love stronger than force. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=1235))

## Chercher veut dire être aveuglé
Il faut simplement être conscient et présent et regarder, observer pour trouver. 

- "When someone is searching," said Siddhartha, "then it might easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind, because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal. Searching means: having a goal. **But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.** You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are directly in front of your eyes." ([Location 1440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=1440))

## Les mots sont vides et incompétents
- The opposite of every truth is just as true! That's like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=1471))
- Or perhaps what I meant was, that love this very stone, and the river, and all these things we are looking at and from which we can learn. I can love a stone, Govinda, and also a tree or a piece of bark. This are things, and things can be loved. But I cannot love words. Therefore, teachings are no good for me, they have no hardness, no softness, no colours, no edges, no smell, no taste, they have nothing but words. Perhaps it are these which keep you from finding peace, perhaps it are the many words. Because salvation and virtue as well, Sansara and Nirvana as well, are mere words, Govinda. There is no thing which would be Nirvana; there is just the word Nirvana." ([Location 1507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09YRG1R2N&location=1507))
