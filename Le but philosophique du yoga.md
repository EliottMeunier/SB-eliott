## Le but philosophique du yoga
- Yoga is one of the six orthodox systems of Indian philosophy. It was collated, co-ordinated and systematised by Patañjali in his classical work, the Yoga Sutras, which consists of 185 terse aphorisms. In Indian thought, everything is permeated by the Supreme Universal Spirit (Paramātmā or God) of which the individual human spirit (jīvātmā) is a part. The system of yoga is so called because it teaches the means by which the jīvātmā can be united to, or be in communion with the Paramātmā, and so secure liberation (mokṣa). One who follows the path of Yoga is a yogi or yogin. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=225))
- ‘When his mind, intellect and self (ahamkāra) are under control, freed from restless desire, so that they rest in the spirit within, a man becomes a Yukta – one in communion with God. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=231))

- ‘**Work alone is your privilege, never the fruits thereof**. **Never let the fruits of action be your motive; and never cease to work**. Work in the name of the Lord, abandoning selfish desires. Be not affected by success or failure. This equipoise is called Yoga.’ ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=241)) #citation 

### Le but du yoga est de se réguler 
- By moderation in eating and in resting, by regulation in working and by concordance in sleeping and waking, Yoga destroys all pain and sorrow.’ ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=245))
- ‘When the senses are stilled, when the mind is at rest, when the intellect wavers not – then, say the wise, is reached the highest stage. This steady control of the senses and mind has been defined as Yoga. He who attains it is free from delusion.’ ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=246)) #citation

De [[Inner Engineering]]
- Stress is not because of work—this is important to remember. Everybody thinks their job is stressful. No job is stressful. There are many jobs that could present challenging situations. There could be nasty bosses, insecure colleagues, emergency rooms, impossible deadlines—or you might even find yourself in the middle of a war zone! But these are not inherently stressful. It is our compulsive reaction to the situations in which we are placed that causes stress. Stress is a certain level of internal friction. One can easily lubricate the inner mechanism with some amount of inner work and awareness. So, it is your inability to handle your own system that is stressing you out. On some level, you do not know how to handle your body, mind, and emotions; that is the problem. ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=1803))

# Références 
De [[Inner Engineering]] : 
- The only thing that stands between you and your well-being is a simple fact: you have allowed your thoughts and emotions to take instruction from the outside rather than the inside. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=412))
- The foundations of peace and bliss are not about attending to the external realities of your life, but in accessing and organizing the inner nature of your being. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=503))
Et surtout : 
- The science of yoga is, quite simply, the science of being in perfect alignment, in absolute harmony, in complete sync with existence. The many fluctuations of the outside world have their impact on each one of us. But yoga is the science of creating inner situations exactly the way you want them. When you fine-tune yourself to such a point where everything functions beautifully within you, naturally the best of your abilities will flow out of you.

De [[Yoga Anatomy]] : 
- This approach to yoga suggests that everything essential for our health and happiness is already present in our systems. We merely need to identify and resolve some of the obstacles that obstruct those natural forces from operating “like a farmer who cuts a dam to allow water to flow into the field where it is needed.” ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=269)) 
- Rather than view asana practice as a way of imposing order on the human system, we encourage you to use the poses as a way of uncovering the intrinsic harmony that is already there. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=276))
