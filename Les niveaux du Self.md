## Les niveaux du Self
- But then there is the Self that is doing the seeing, the Self that is doing the describing, the actual Seer, the Observing Self, the Witness. This Self does the seeing, but cannot itself be seen—no more than an eye could see itself or a tongue could taste itself. ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BMYXTU0&location=1824))
- But what happens, at each stage of Growing Up, is that you will identify your small, conventional, finite, subjective self with the particular level or hidden map of that stage. And the Witness will then look through that small self and its map at the world, using that map to interpret what it sees.
