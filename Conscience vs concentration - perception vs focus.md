## Conscience vs concentration - perception vs focus
- “Awareness” is open, free, totally relaxed, inclusive of All that arises, and living in the timeless Now—Present to Present to Present. “Attention,” by contrast, is focused, contracted, never aware of the Total Painting but always narrowly directed to just a particular feature of it, living in the temporal present moving from the past to the future, unable to let go and fall into the ever-present Now, always constricting consciousness to the narrow-slit present existing in between the past and the future, focused on one item at a time by one item at a time by one item at a time.
