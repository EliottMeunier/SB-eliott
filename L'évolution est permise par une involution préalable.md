### Rappel 
- The traditional “Great Chain of Being” is usually given as something
  like: matter, body, mind, soul, and spirit. In the Vedanta, for
  example, these are, respectively, the 5 sheaths or levels of Spirit:
  annamayakosha (the sheath or level made of physical food), the
  pranamayakosha (the level made of élan vital), the manomayakosha
  (the level made of mind), the vijnanamayakosha (the level made of
  higher mind or soul), and anandamayakosha (the level made of
  transcendental bliss or causal spirit. Vedanta, of course, adds turiya, or
  the transcendental ever-present Self, and turiyatita, or the nondual,
  ever-present, unqualifiable Spirit-as-such, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdnsw4daacwkj0z2exf26z7))

### Démonstration 
- according to the traditions, this entire process of evolution or “un-
  folding” could never occur without a prior process of involution or “in-
  folding.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdpn84enm84r20wrt91a8gh))
- That is, the lower dimensions or levels are actually
  sediments or deposits of the higher dimensions, and they find their
  meaning because of the higher dimensions of which they are a stepped-
  down or diluted version. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdpnf0m1042rakzb2qyf4nj))
- According to the traditions, before
  evolution or the unfolding of Spirit can occur, involution or the
  infolding of Spirit must occur: the higher successively steps down into
  the lower. Thus, the higher levels appear to emerge “out of” the lower
  levels during evolution—for example, life appears to emerge out of
  matter—because, and only because, they were first deposited there by
  involution. You cannot get the higher out of the lower unless the higher
  were already there, in potential—sleeping, as it were—waiting to
  emerge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdpnw30fmcm2as9bgnw4598))
- If we can represent the major emergent stages in evolution as (A), (A +
  B), (A + B + C), and so on—where the addition signs mean that
  something is emerging or being added to manifestation—then we could
  represent involution as the prior subtraction process: Spirit starts out
  full and complete, with all of manifestation contained as potential in
  itself, which we can represent in brackets: [A + B + C + D + E]. Spirit
  first steps down into manifestation—and begins to “lose” itself in
  manifestation—by shedding its pure spiritual nature and assuming a
  manifest, finite, limited form—namely, the soul [A + B + C + D]. The
  soul has now forgotten “E,” or its radical identity with and as Spirit,
  and, in the ensuing confusion and angst, the soul flees this terror by
  stepping down into mind [A + B + C], which has forgotten “D,” its soul
  radiance; and mind flees into life, forgetting “C,” or its intelligence; and
  finally life sheds even its vegetative vitality “B” and appears as inert,
  insentient, lifeless matter, “A”—at which point something like the Big
  Bang occurs, whereupon matter blows into concrete existence and it
  appears that in the entire manifest world, there exists nothing but
  insentient, dead, lifeless matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdpvmvzt23attb4qavc8sjk))
