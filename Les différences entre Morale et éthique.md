## Les différences entre Morale et éthique
- “Morals” are different from “ethics.” Ethics involve the rules and regulations that any particular culture or group takes to be the way things should be done. It focuses on what is good according to that culture. Morals, on the other hand, focus not just on what is correct for a particular group, but what is correct according to universal principles—not what is good, but what is right.

- “Ethics,” again, is confined to the Lower Left quadrant—it’s a reading of your culture’s contextual background (a validity claim of appropriateness). “Morals” is a judgment not of “appropriateness” or “goodness” but of “rightness,” which can be made in relation to phenomena found, not just in the Lower Left, but in any quadrant—including, for example, “What is the morally right thing to do in relation to the Lower Right ecological system we find ourselves in?” or “What is the morally right thing to do with this lost stash of money that I found [in the Upper Right]?” or “What is the right thing to do with this idea that I’m claiming as my own [in the Upper Left] but that was discovered by somebody else?” ([Location 3158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BMYXTU0&location=3158))
