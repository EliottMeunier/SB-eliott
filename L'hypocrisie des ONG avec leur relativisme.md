## L'hypocrisie des ONG avec leur relativisme
- The standard NGO, with its postmodern relativistic values, believes that no culture is superior or better than another; and yet it goes into countries where it is working, and assumes that its own values are in some ways better than or superior to those of the culture it is helping—otherwise, why would it consider what it is doing as being “help,” if it didn’t have something more valuable to offer than what those receiving the “help” presently have? Thus many NGOs (with their level-6 values) go to work in a developing country whose major values are still at tribal red power (level 3) or traditional mythic fundamentalism (level 4) and attempt to impose their level-6 pluralistic values on the culture and population, and the whole endeavor backfires badly.
