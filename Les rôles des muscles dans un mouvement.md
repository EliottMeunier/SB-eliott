## Les rôles des muscles dans un mouvement
Ce ne sont pas pas des rôles absolus, ce sont des rôles relatifs à un mouvement. 

The starting place is a specific joint, the focal joint, and a specific joint action. For every joint action there are muscles that create the movement and muscles that oppose the movement. The muscles that create the joint action are called your **agonists**, or prime movers, and the muscles that create the opposite joint action are called your **antagonists**.

The muscles that support and modulate the action of the agonist or antagonist muscles are called **synergistic** muscles. Your synergistic muscles also **act to minimize excess movement at a joint** or in one part of your body to support movement in another part. When synergists act in this way, they are also called fixators. Alternatively, the term synergistic is used to describe a whole group of muscles that work together to create an action. Synergistic muscles are essential for maintaining balanced joint space and for the health of your joint. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=950))
