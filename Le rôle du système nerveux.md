## Le rôle du système nerveux
- All the cells of our nervous system work together to pick up sensory input, process it, and generate a motoric response. Each motor response creates new experiences to sense, which leads to more processing and more responses. This cycle is called a sensory–motor loop; it happens constantly and continually in order to make the precise adjustments needed for us to survive, adapt, learn, and grow throughout our lives.
