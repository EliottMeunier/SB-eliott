## Highlights
- Working memory is a limited capacity store for retaining information for a brief period while performing mental operations on that information.
  Working memory is a multi-component system which includes the central executive, visuospatial sketchpad, phonological loop, and episodic buffer.
  Working memory is important for reasoning, learning and comprehension.
  Working memory theories assume that complex reasoning and learning tasks require a mental workspace to hold and manipulate information. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444439939/17455433))
- Working memory is short-term memory. However, instead of all information going into one single store, there are different systems for different types of information. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444439939/17455434))
- The central executive is the most important component of the model, although little is known about how it functions. It is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the operation of the slave systems (i.e., visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop) and relates them to long term memory (LTM).
  The central executive decides which information is attended to and which parts of the working memory to send that information to be dealt with. For example, two activities sometimes come into conflict, such as driving a car and talking. Rather than hitting a cyclist who is wobbling all over the road, it is preferable to stop talking and concentrate on driving. The central executive directs attention and gives priority to particular activities. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444439939/17455444))
- The phonological store (linked to speech perception) acts as an inner ear and holds information in a speech-based form (i.e., spoken words) for 1-2 seconds. Spoken words enter the store directly. Written words must first be converted into an articulatory (spoken) code before they can enter the phonological store. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444439939/17455447))
- The articulatory control process (linked to speech production) acts like an inner voice rehearsing information from the phonological store. It circulates information round and round like a tape loop. This is how we remember a telephone number we have just heard. As long as we keep repeating it, we can retain the information in working memory. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444439939/17455448))
- the visuospatial sketchpad (inner eye) deals with visual and spatial information. Visual information refers to what things look like. It is likely that the visuospatial sketchpad plays an important role in helping us keep track of where we are in relation to other objects as we move through our environment (Baddeley, 1997).
  As we move around, our position in relation to objects is constantly changing and it is important that we can update this information. For example, being aware of where we are in relation to desks, chairs and tables when we are walking around a classroom means that we don't bump into things too often!

- The original model was updated by Baddeley (2000) after the model failed to explain the results of various experiments. An additional component was added called the episodic buffer. The episodic buffer acts as a 'backup' store which communicates with both long-term memory and the components of working memory. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444439939/17455453))
