## Sthira et Sukha dans le yoga Structure et Vide
- In the language of yoga, the stable boundary is **sthira**, and the open space is **sukha**. In Sanskrit, sthira can mean firm, hard, solid, compact, strong, unfluctuating, durable, lasting, or permanent. Sukha is composed of two roots: su meaning good and kha meaning space. It means easy, pleasant, agreeable, gentle, and mild. It also refers to a state of well-being, free of obstacles. All successful living things must balance containment and permeability, rigidity and plasticity, persistence and adaptability, space and boundaries. Successful human-made structures also exhibit a balance of sthira and sukha. For example, a suspension bridge is flexible enough to survive wind and earthquakes, but stable enough to support its load-bearing surfaces.
