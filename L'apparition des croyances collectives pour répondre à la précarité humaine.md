## L'apparition des croyances collectives pour répondre à la précarité humaine
On a créé des religions pour nous permettre de comprendre les incertitudes de la vie. Mais devant le chaos croissant, ce genre de croyances ne mène qu'à des désillusions. La religion peut être une solution temporaire au manque de sens, mais seule, elle ne suffit pas. Elle ne permet pas un bonheur durable. 

Over the course of human evolution, as each group of people became gradually aware of the enormity of its isolation in the cosmos and of the precariousness of its hold on survival, it developed myths and beliefs to transform the random, crushing forces of the universe into manageable, or at least understandable, patterns.
An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail.
This overweening presumption about what we are entitled to from a universe that is basically insensitive to human needs, generally leads to trouble.
The shields that have worked in the past—the order that religion, patriotism, ethnic traditions, and habits instilled by social classes used to provide—are no longer effective for increasing numbers of people who feel exposed to the harsh winds of chaos. 
If a person does take the time out to reflect, the disillusionment returns: after each success it becomes clearer that money, power, status, and possessions do not, by themselves, necessarily add one iota to the quality of life.
Religions are only temporarily successful attempts to cope with the lack of meaning in life; they are not permanent answers.
