## La différence entre Magique et Mythique
Magique : la miracle est dans l'humain
Mythique : le miracle est dans le dieu

- A brief note on the name “Magic-Mythic.” In many ways, this is a transition stage between the pure Magic of the previous stage and the pure Mythic of the following stage. The difference between “magic” and “mythic” depends primarily on where “miracle” power is located. That is, in magic, the capacity to perform miracles resides (“magically”) in the self. I do a rain dance, and it forces nature to rain. Thoughts and images are poorly differentiated from real things, and thus, for example, if my father dies, and I just recently wished him dead, then I caused his death. Or we mentioned Voodoo, where if you stick a pin in an image of the real person, the real person is actually hurt. This is all pure, undiluted magic. Historically, by the time that Mythic began to emerge, humankind had begun to understand that it couldn’t really perform magic—but supernatural, transcendental, mythic Beings could: God, Goddess, Spirit. If only I could find the exact ritual or prayer or action that would please Spirit and cause it to intervene in history on my behalf, to make the crops grow, or make the rain fall, or ensure success for the day’s hunt. “Magic-Mythic” was—is—a transition between these two major stages. It usually locates “miracle power” in Gods or Spirit(s)—PowerGods—but certain powerful humans can be PowerGods. Mommy, for example, could turn the yucky spinach into candy if she wanted—she’s a PowerGod. And historically at this stage, as the first great military empires began to spread across the globe, the heads of these empires were almost universally seen as being literally Gods, and very powerful—they were PowerGods.

- next major stage of development, level 4—called the “conformist,” “mythic-membership,” “diplomat,” or “belongingness” stage (given the color amber)—the self can indeed begin to take the role of other, and thus its identity can expand from its own self to belongingness in various groups: its family, its clan, its tribe, its nation, its religion, its political party, and so on. This is referred to as the switch from an egocentric to an ethnocentric identity—a switch from “me-focused” to “us-focused” or “group-focused.” This is a very important switch. As one of its names implies, this is initially a very conformist stage—the self can take the role of other, but it is caught in that role, a view often called “my country, right or wrong,” or “my religion, right or wrong,” or “law and order.” ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BMYXTU0&location=695))
