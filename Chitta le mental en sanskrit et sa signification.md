## Chitta le mental en sanskrit et sa signification
The word chitta denotes the mind in its total or collective sense as being composed of three categories: 
- (a) mind (manas, that is, the individual mind having the power and faculty of attention, selection and rejection; it is the oscillating indecisive faculty of the mind); 
- (b) intelligence or reason (buddhi, that is, the decisive state which determines the distinction between things) and 
- (c) ego (ahamkāra, literally the I-maker, the state which ascertains that ‘I know’). ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=250))
- Yoga is the method by which the restless mind is calmed and the energy directed into constructive channels. As a mighty river which when properly harnessed by dams and canals, creates a vast reservoir of water, prevents famine and provides abundant power for industry; so also the mind, when controlled, provides a reservoir of peace and generates abundant energy for human uplift. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=254))
- ‘Undoubtedly, the mind is restless and hard to control. But it can be trained by constant practice (abhyāsa) and by freedom from desire (vairāgya). A man who cannot control his mind will find it difficult to attain this divine communion; but the self-controlled man can attain it if he tries hard and directs his energy by the right means.’ ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=261))
