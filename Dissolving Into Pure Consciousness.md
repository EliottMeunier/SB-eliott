- issolving into consciousness isn’t a word-play game or a mental idea. You can’t simply say, “Oh, well, I’m already consciousness, cool. Great.

- Sitting in silent awareness helps to reveal the truth of consciousness. All the ideas, upset emotions, wounds, and so forth took space.

It’s like all the boxes and junk in your living room have been removed, and now you are feeling so much better. It’s still your living room, but you’ve got so much more room to stretch out and enjoy life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbpb27ygdskkh0w7v4qcmme))
