## C'est le prix qui définit le coût pas l'inverse
Quand on crée une formation, il faut se demander : et si je la vendais 2000€ ? 
Alors à ce moment là, on peut commencer à réfléchir à tout ce qu'on pourrait mettre à l'intérieur. Réflechir dans le sens inverse n'a pas de sens. Sinon, le prix et la valeur seront toujours 2 entités distinctes. 

- Price should drive costs, not the other way around. It took me a long time to understand the significance of this rule. We are wired to think that price is connected to cost. You calculate the cost of the raw materials you use, the time it takes to produce a good or service, you add some amount for profit, and that’s your price. With intangibles, like our time, we look to competitors and charge around whatever it is they do. This is precisely backward. Think of making a luxury car. You would prefer to have a sense of how much people would pay for a certain degree of luxury before you began choosing the materials to go into the vehicle. You determine the price point, and then you reverse engineer the vehicle in line with those costs that can justify the price. You include the smooth leather but recognize that hand-tooling might bump the car’s cost beyond your optimal price.
