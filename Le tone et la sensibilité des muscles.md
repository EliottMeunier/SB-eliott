## Le tone et la sensibilité des muscles
- Muscles work best when they can calibrate tone.   One basic definition of the word tone is “**readiness to respond**.” A tissue that has high tone needs less stimulation before a response is elicited because the tissue is more prepared to respond. On the other hand, a tissue with a lower tone needs more stimulation before a response happens. Although it is related, this is not the same thing as sensitivity. A tissue can be sensitive and have low tone. It might register a stimulus at a very fine level but not react until it receives a great deal of that stimulus. Alternatively, a tissue can have high tone and low sensitivity, where it is ready to respond but not actually responding because it isn’t picking up stimulus. All tissues need to be able to change tone in response to changes in the environment, both internal and external. The important thing is not the absolute state of tone but your tissue’s ability to adapt. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=1006))
