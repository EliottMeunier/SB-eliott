## La pensée abstraite naît avec le niveau orange et permet le passage au mondocentrique
- And at the very next higher level, orange level 5, there occurs the emergence of the next higher perspective, a 3rd-person perspective, which is the capacity to take an objective, scientific, universal perspective; thus the switch in identity from a local ethnocentric identity to a universal or global worldcentric identity occurs—a switch from “us” to “all of us.” This more universal, global, expansive awareness occurs because consciousness moves from what is called a concrete operational mode to a formal operational mode. “Formal operations” means that thought can operate not just on the concrete material world, but thought can now operate on thought itself. Thought can actually be aware of itself, and thus an introspective, conscientious, self-reflective, universal identity—a cosmopolitan identity—can become possible. Kant suggested a definition of cosmopolitan awareness when he wrote in the essay “Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch” that “a violation of rights anywhere is felt everywhere.” In other words, there is a deeply felt solidarity with all of humanity, and the issue of the universal rights of humans comes to the fore for the first time at level 5 (as it first did in history with the Enlightenment).

- The worldcentric individual emerges out of the ethnocentric conformist, and within the worldcentric background, the self wants its own high self-recognition, self-identity, self-esteem, and self-achievement. So this stage is also marked by the emergence of the drive toward excellence, accomplishment, merit, achievement, and progress.
