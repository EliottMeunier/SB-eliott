## L'approche intégrale combine le waking up et le growing up
- One **or** the other, Waking Up or Growing Up—such has been humanity’s history. But with what’s called the “Integral approach”—that new leading-edge model just mentioned—both of these paths are combined for the first time, producing a method of growth and development that is truly profound and effective in virtually every conceivable way.

- the simplest way to remember the difference between these structures of consciousness and these states of consciousness is that the structures—the hidden levels of grammar, or the hidden maps—are the basis of Growing Up; whereas the states of consciousness, leading to Awakening and Enlightenment, are the basis of Waking Up. In Growing Up, we move from less developed stages or maps of our world, to more adequate, more mature, more developed stages or maps, a true Growing Up. While with Waking Up, we move from less whole and less advanced states to the highest, most developed states imaginable, leading to a genuine transformative Awakening, Enlightenment, Great Liberation, Metamorphosis, Satori, or Supreme Identity, as it’s variously termed.

- So literature is not merely imaginary; it’s “true but partial.” And so are virtually all of the other disciplines that humans engage in. So the question is no longer “Which of these approaches is true?” but rather, “How is our world organized such that all of these approaches possess some aspect of the truth?” In other words, “everybody is right”—to some degree. So, what interests Integral Theory is not “Which one is right?” but “How can we put them all together?” The word “integral” itself means comprehensive, inclusive, embracing, enfolding—putting things all together.
