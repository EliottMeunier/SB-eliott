## Highlights
- It means using your whole mind to find solutions. Creativity means not being paralyzed by your methods and knowledge, but being able to think outside the box (sometimes very quickly) to find solutions to unforeseen problems. This kind of situation requires logic and analysis, but also big-picture thinking. And big-picture thinking is a creative aptitude.

- When it comes to locomotion, humans are not as efficient as other animals, Jobs said. But a human on a bicycle is the most efficient animal on the planet. The bicycle amplifies our input in an enormously productive way. Isn’t this what a computer—the most magnificent tool of our time—should do? ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=725))
- How much time do I have? What’s the venue like? What time of the day will I be speaking? Who is the audience? What is their background? What do they expect of me? Why was I asked to speak? What do I want them to do? Which visual medium is most appropriate for this particular situation and audience? What is the fundamental purpose of my talk? What’s the big picture here? And this is the most fundamental question of all, stripped down to its essence: ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=821))
- What is my point? Why does it matter? ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=845))
- Slow down your busy mind to see your problem and goals more clearly. Find time alone to see the big picture. Take a “forest bath.” For greater focus, try turning off the computer and going analog. Use paper and pens or a whiteboard to record and sketch out your ideas. Key questions: What’s your main (core) point? Why does it matter? If your audience remembers only one thing, what should it be? Preparing a detailed handout keeps you from feeling compelled to cram everything into your visuals. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=971))
- “sticky” ideas have six key principles in common: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions, and stories. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=996))
- Simplicity. If everything is important, then nothing is important. If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. You must be ruthless in your efforts to simplify—not dumb down—your message to its absolute core. We’re not talking about stupid sound bites here. Every idea can be reduced to its essential meaning if you work hard enough. For your presentation, what’s the key point? What’s the core? Why does (or should) it matter? ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1014))
- Unexpectedness. You can get people’s interest by violating their expectations. Surprise people. Surprise will get their interest. But to sustain their interest, you have to stimulate their curiosity. The best way to do that is to pose questions or open holes in people’s knowledge and then fill those holes. Make the audience aware that they have a gap in their knowledge, and then fill that gap with the answers to the puzzle (or guide them to the answers). Take people on a journey. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1018))
- Concreteness. Use natural speech, and give real examples with real things, not abstractions. Speak of concrete images, not of vague notions. Proverbs are good, say the Heath brothers, at reducing abstract concepts to concrete, simple but powerful (and memorable) language. For example, the expression iiseki ni cho or “kill two birds with one stone” is easier than saying something like “let’s work toward maximizing our productivity by increasing efficiency across many departments.” And the phrase “go to the moon and back” by JFK (and Ralph Kramden before him)? Now that’s concrete. You can visualize that. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1022))
- Emotions. People are emotional beings. It is not enough to take people through a laundry list of talking points and information on your slides; you must make them feel something. There are a million ways to help people feel something about your content. Images are one way to have audiences not only understand your point better but also have a more visceral and emotional connection to your idea. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1034))
- Stories. We tell stories all day long. We tell stories with our words and even with our art and music. We express ourselves through the stories we share. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1045))
- Basic elements to include in your story: Identify the problem. (This could be a problem, for example, that your product solves.) Identify causes of the problem. (Give actual examples of the conflict surrounding the problem.) Show how and why you solved the problem. (This is where you provide resolution to the conflict.) ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1109))
- People who possess loads of information in a particular field have historically been in hot demand and able to charge high fees for access to their stuffed, fact-filled brains. This was so because facts used to be difficult to access. Not anymore. In an era when information about seemingly anything is only a click away, just possessing information is hardly the differentiator it used to be. What is more important today than ever before is the ability to synthesize the facts and give them context and perspective. ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1186))
- Storyboarding can help. If you take the time in this part of the preparation stage to set up your ideas in a logical fashion in storyboard format, you can then visualize the sequential movement of your content narrative and the overall flow and feel of the presentation. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1234))
- The Zen aesthetic values include (but are not limited to) the following: Simplicity Subtlety Elegance Suggestion (rather than literal description) Naturalness (i.e., nothing artificial or forced) Empty space (or negative space) Stillness, tranquility Eliminating the nonessential ([Location 1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1513))
- Simplicity is powerful and leads to greater clarity, yet it is neither simple nor easy to achieve. It’s not about making it easy for us, it’s about making things easy for them. Simplicity can be obtained through the careful reduction of the nonessential. As you design slides, in addition to simplicity, keep the following concepts in mind: subtlety, balance, and understated elegance. Good designs have plenty of empty space. Think “subtract” not “add.” Although simplicity is the goal, it is possible to be too simple. Your job is to find the balance most appropriate to your situation. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1687))
- For our purposes, the SNR is the ratio of relevant to irrelevant elements and information in a slide or other display. The goal is to have the highest signal-to-noise ratio possible in your slides. ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1770))
- According to the picture superiority effect, pictures are remembered better than words—especially when people are casually exposed to the information and the exposure is for a very limited time. ([Location 1879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=1879))
- Empty space, also called negative space or white space, is a concept that is supremely simple, yet the most difficult for people to apply. Whether designing a document or slide, the urge to fill empty areas with more elements is just too great. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=2057))
- Empty space can convey a feeling of high quality, sophistication, and importance. ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=2062))
- you need to explain something complex, don’t present all of the information at once. Instead, animate (or build) the slide so that the different parts of your chart or diagram appear one after the other in logical and clear steps. Simplicity, restraint, and balance are important considerations when designing slides and other multimedia. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=2259))
- A good rule of thumb when judging your own visuals is to ask ourselves: (1) Does the visual get attention or bring the eye of the viewer in to the screen? (2) Is the visual easy to understand quickly, and does it help the viewer understand your verbal message? (3) Does the visual—including the display of data—help the viewer remember your message? (4) Will the visual help your audience not only to understand and remember your message, but will it even help to change the thinking or behavior of your audience long after your talk is finished. Number (4) may not apply in every case, but numbers (1)–(3) are crucial in almost every situation. ([Location 2382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=2382))
- Consider fully, act decisively. ([Location 2659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=2659))
- Don’t Take Yourself So Seriously! “Lighten up,” says Ben Zander, “and you lighten up those around you.” ([Location 2741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=2741))
- it is not always more that makes us happy, but rather it is the intentional selection of less, ([Location 3227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081TDWTX8&location=3227))
