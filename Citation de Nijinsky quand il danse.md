## Citation de Nijinsky quand il danse
Quand tu est parfaitement connecté à la performance, à l'instant, ton sens du toi disparaît. 
- For the Russian ballet dancer Nijinsky, his entire life was dance. There were moments when he would leap to heights that seemed humanly impossible. Even if one’s muscles are at peak performance, there is still a limit to how high one can jump. But in some moments he would seem to transcend even that limit. People often asked him, “How do you manage this?” He said, “There is no way I can ever do it. When Nijinsky is not there, only then it happens.” ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=1350))
- When someone is constantly giving a hundred percent, a point comes when one surpasses all limits and reaches total effortlessness. Effortlessness does not mean becoming a couch potato. It means transcending the need for physical action. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=1354))
