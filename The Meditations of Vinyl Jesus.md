## Highlights
- In the book, he posits a path of creation for artists to follow:
  • The universe is the “source” of all creativity. It is the source of an energy that we all tap into.
  • The universe pushes this energy as “data” toward the artist. It’s a cacophony of emotions, visual stimuli, and sounds that the artist stores in a “vessel.”
  • The artist develops a “filter” to determine what is allowed to reside in the vessel.
  • The work of an artist is to shape their life so they can get closer to the source.
  • They channel that source into something of personal value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnfxddngrfqkte1m66zv28r))

Instead, notice them in the same connected, detached way you might notice a warm wind. Let yourself move within it, yet not be *of* it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnfzv4sjdpx7fgxz6n7mzen))

That's how I did it, so it will work for you.” A better way to think about it is: it depends on where you're starting from. If you're starting north of Rome, then you have to go south. If you're starting from Greece, you've gotta take a boat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsng6fcqccndv8qnyxvq2r54))
