## Highlights
- Process Philosophy. “Process” thought, which emphasizes the fluid, non-static nature of all things, critiques traditional philosophical outlooks which posit some “ultimate reality” behind all change — a transcendent reality that is eternal, static and perfect. This idea is a prominent one in the Western tradition; and Process philosophy basically accuses it of having been, for millennia, problematically obsessed with perfection ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1462507127/18061897))
- In short, I’ve come to feel that my escape from obsessive thoughts consists in the very acceptance of their existence. I must let them come, and let them pass away ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1462507127/18061907))
- Thoughts are good; without them there’s no consciousness — but they must be let go, for consciousness to flow. Form is good; without it there could be nothing in material existence — but the forms of things must be allowed to change, beings must be allowed to pass away, matter itself must flow. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1462507127/18061918))
- This is not an arbitrary need, but is rooted in the very nature of the world, the cosmos. The Greek cosmos, by which we refer to our universe as a whole, literally means an ordering of forms. Without form, there is chaos — which originally meant absence, or empty space, before it took on the meaning of disorder. And so to champion structurelessness altogether, to prize “process” over “fixed form” in an absolute way, is tantamount to advocating that nothing should exist at all.

- Process is characterized by the passage of forms. You can’t have a process of nothing — a process must be of something, and it “is” — or rather it continuously becomes — forms in the cosmic flux. The forms come to be, and pass away again. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1462507127/18062218))
- Radical incompleteness is not about rejecting fixations, but about acknowledging their temporary nature, and honoring the passage between them and whatever may follow. It too can be religious — a religion which is not fixed, but a constant revelation. For true mysticism sees order in the disorder — form in the flux — rather than trying to impose it on the world.
