## Un gouvernement doit priviligier la croissance des moments dans le flow plutôt que du PIB
Pour garder un équilibre social, un système politique doit avoir des organismes qui facilient l'entrée dans le flow. De plus, un individu grandit et devient de plus en plus complexe avec les expériences dans le flow donc on devrait mettre le focus principal d'un état non sur le PIB mais sur un nouvel indice qui valorise ça.

it is probably true that no social system has ever survived long unless its people had some hope that their government would help them achieve happiness.

If we assume, however, that the desire to achieve optimal experience is the foremost goal of every human being, the difficulties of interpretation raised by cultural relativism become less severe. Each social system can then be evaluated in terms of how much psychic entropy it causes, measuring that disorder not with reference to the ideal order of one or another belief system, but with reference to the goals of the members of that society. A starting point would be to say that one society is “better” than another if a greater number of its people have access to experiences that are in line with their goals. A second essential criterion would specify that these experiences should lead to the growth of the self on an individual level, by allowing as many people as possible to develop increasingly complex skills.
