## Les 5 étapes de l'éveil spirituel
- 4 or 5 major stages of unfolding: usually following a preliminary awakening experience, they move through a gross purification, a subtle illumination, a dark night or infinite abyss, and a unity consciousness—or gross, subtle, causal, unity.

- - the 5 or so major states of awareness—gross/waking, subtle/dreaming, causal/deep sleep, empty witnessing, and pure nondual “unity”)— ([Location 1689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BMYXTU0&location=1689))
- as you take up a mindfulness-type of meditation, and you are presently identified with, say, the waking state, is that you will start to slowly become aware during dreaming states as well. Your Wakefulness will shift from just the waking into the dream state also. You will start to become conscious and aware of the subtle realm and all its secrets.
