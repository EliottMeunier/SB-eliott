## Vue cohérente des énergies subtiles par Ken Wilber

#### Partie 1 du raisonnement : more UR = more UL
- ==Increasing complexity of form (in the UR) is correlated with
  increasing interior consciousness (in the UL).== This was Teilhard de
  Chardin’s “law of complexity and consciousness”—namely, the more of
  the former, the more of the latter. As we might put it more precisely,
  the greater the degree of exterior complexity of material form, the
  greater the degree of interior consciousness that can be enacted within
  that form (i.e., correlation of UR and UL). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdv56bqv84hhp7t08wxr157))
- Further—and this is the connecting hypothesis—==increasing
  complexity of gross form is correlated with increasingly subtlety of
  energies==. As evolution proceeds to more and more complex gross
  forms, the increasing degree of gross complexity is accompanied by
  subtler and subtler corresponding (or signature) **energy patterns**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdv5qk9mzvyzyfrcza88cts))
- ==increasing evolution brings increasing complexity of gross form (in the
  UR), which is correlated with an increasing degree of consciousness (in
  the UL), and, in the UR itself, a subtilization of corresponding energies==. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdv5za3nt7fe2r1cc1h7301))
- Thus, instead of interpreting higher levels as being essentially divorced
  from gross matter or gross form, the complexification of gross form is
  the vehicle of manifestation for both subtler energies and greater
  consciousness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdv69skjww6fnsssbs7m2dc))

#### Partie 2 : Conscience = énergie
- Common to many traditions is the idea that, **in addition to a spectrum of consciousness, there is a spectrum of energy**. One such spectrum runs ==from gross physical energy, to etheric energy, to astral energy, to
  psychic energy, to causal energy==. Without, at this point, arguing the
  details, let’s simply accept that as a type of subtle-energy spectrum that
  might exist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdv8gh37y3szzn3bcsk5xxf))
##### Mais précision
According to the traditions, these energies are not the same as consciousness; consciousness cannot be reduced to these energies; nor can these energies be reduced to consciousness. Rather, these levels of energy accompany and support their correlative levels of consciousness (so that a gross energy is the support of gross

#### Partie 3 : Illustration des 2 points précédents 
- The earliest forms of evolution—such as quarks, electrons, protons,
  atoms, and molecules—are accompanied by the four, major, gross
  energy-forces: electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak
  nuclear. It is common to refer to these as “**physical**” energies or
  “**gross**” energies, and that is fine, as long as we remember that these
  “physical” or “material” energies are not the whole of matter-energy,
  but simply the lowest levels of matter-energy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdw4ehdkestk1kmetqr8v4q))
- With the emergence, during evolution, of the complex material forms
  that we call “life” (starting with viruses and prokaryotes), a more subtle
  energy—often called “**etheric**”—emerges. As indicated, **these etheric
  energy fields are said to surround the physical energy fields in a holonic fashion** (i.e., as spheres of increasing expanse). 
- To continue the natural history of subtle energies: at the point where the
  evolution of increasingly complex gross form produces a triune brain, a
  yet subtler energy—known as “**psychic**”—emerges. “Psychic,” in this
  case, simply means “thought fields,” which are said to be produced by
  sustained mental activity. These fields surround and envelop the
  physical, etheric, and astral—but they ONLY emerge in, through, and
  around material forms that are complex enough to include triune brains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdwhbk06s9kaa1n82kqc87v))

##### Précision : Les champs énergétiques sont agencés dans une fashion holonic 
- This is why the consciousness, forms, and energy fields are all
  holarchical. They are all nested hierarchies of transcend and include.
  In the exterior domains, which are marked by their extension in
  spacetime, you can actually see many of these holarchies: in the UR,
  cells physically envelop molecules, which physically envelop atoms.
  Likewise, in the UR, the psychic energy field surrounds and envelops
  (transcends and includes) the astral field, which surrounds and envelops
  the etheric, which surrounds and envelops the physical…. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdwm54ke2904hyra0ppsmx4))

#### Partie 4 : Connecter tout cela aux découvertes de la science
##### 4.1 : Le Wave Potential
- In QM theory, the wave potential is a
  vast source of creative energy that gives rise to denser material
  particles, including, eventually, particles such as quarks, electrons, and
  protons. It is this “creatrix” nature of the quantum potential that has led
  many scientists to equate it with a spiritual potentiality, a type of vast
  field of infinite potentials that is unbounded spirit or limitless
  consciousness itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdxwszpv593grbz3n0r8emz))

##### 4.2 : Le WP a été mal interprété par les scientifiques car le plus haut le niveau, le plus loin on est de cette énergie créatrice !
- If that were the case, then the sequence of evolution would be
  something like this: out of the spiritual/quantum potential comes
  subatomic particles, which eventually gather together into atoms, which
  then gather together into molecules, which then form cells, which then
  form organisms…. **In other words, in that scheme, the higher the level
  of evolution, the farther away from God you get.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdxwwp3szax1b8861jqzwbm))

##### 4.3 Rappel des premières idées 
- In involution or creation, radically unqualifiable Spirit decides to play a
  game of hide-and-seek, and hence “forgets” itself and throws itself
  outward to create a manifest world of manyness and otherness. As we
  saw, the first thing pure Spirit creates is soul, which then throws itself
  outward to create mind, which throws itself outward to create life (or
  prana), which then throws itself outward to create insentient matter
  (quarks, atoms). At the end of that ontological sequence, matter blows
  into existence as a crystallization and condensation of prana. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdxx2tda5x31ydwg50bsyf8))

##### 4.4 Donc comment mettre le WP dans tout cela
- In other words, the quantum potential is not spirit but prana. More
  technically, the quantum potential is not spirit-as-spirit, it is not spirit-
  as-soul, it is not spirit-as-mind, but rather, the quantum potential is
  spirit-as-prana, which gives rise to spirit-as-matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdxx646hf2j0g7sk20572gf))

##### 4.5 Conclusion des 4 points précédents
- As suggested, this equating of quantum (or subquantum, or string, or
  symmetry) realities with some sort of nondual Spirit is perhaps the
  single biggest theoretical confusion in the entire field. First, because it
  confuses the nature of involution and evolution, and hence confuses the
  beginning of the involutionary sequence—namely, causal spirit—with
  the beginning of the evolutionary sequence—namely, the vacuum
  potential (or some such), which actually represents spirit-as-prana, not
  spirit-as-spirit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdy2pz3ansd5sv2ypezmpnh))
