## Les fonctions des différents tissus du corps
- Muscles create movement, joints enable movement, and connective tissue translates movement from tissue to tissue. Bones absorb and transmit movement, and nerves coordinate and organize the whole gorgeous dance. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=767))

Si on ne les utilise pas correctement : 
- Bones support weight; muscles move bones.   There is an enormous difference between how your muscles work when they are moving your bones into place to take weight and how they work when they are attempting to hold the weight themselves. When your muscles take on a weight-bearing function, they can overwork and become rigid and fixed. If your bones bear weight instead, your muscles can stay constantly moving and can continuously make microadjustments to create efficient movement and dynamic stillness along an entire pathway of weight.
