Become the book and teach its contents to your future readers.  
By helping them through the process yourself, you’ll learn what they need, and in what order.  
You’ll figure out which examples resonate and which exercises work.  
Volunteer to give them free, expert guidance about an outcome that they care about.  
Instead of attempting to believe that your advice is worth sharing, go out and prove that it is by helping real people and seeing if it works.  
  
Record the first draft as audio and use an AI transcription service.  
  
If I don’t do my writing first thing, then I don’t do my writing.  
  
Readers will feel engaged and rewarded so long as it regularly delivers the next piece of whatever they were promised on the cover.  
  
Arrange the content around the learner’s goals.  
  
Read it all every day from the start, correcting as you go along.  
Then go on from where you stopped the day before.  
When it gets so long that you can’t do this every day, read back two or three chapters each day.  
Then each week read it all from the start.  
That’s how you make it all of one piece.
