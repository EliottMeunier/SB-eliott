## Highlights
- Every time you respond to a distraction — a new email in your inbox, a notification on your phone, a red badge on an app — you are training your mind to value the new at the expense of the important. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=308))
- One of the most important discoveries in cognitive science in recent years is that cognition is embodied and situated. This means that our primary mode of thinking is not manipulating abstract symbols (like a computer does), but rather using our body (thus embodiment) to directly interact with the environment (which is situated). In this way, we “offload” some of our cognitive processing onto our environment, which is after all capable of storing information much better than our brains are. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=745))
- The problem is that when I really ask myself “Why didn’t I have a healthy lunch today?”, it usually isn’t a faulty trigger, a lackluster reward, or flaws in any of the dozen supporting strategies I’ve researched and taught. It’s usually because I didn’t have a filling, healthy breakfast. And that was because I didn’t get up early enough. And that was because I went to bed late. And that was because I worked late, because I didn’t get enough done that day, because I didn’t have enough energy, because…I didn’t have a healthy lunch. In other words, the answer seems to often be “Because I didn’t do other habits.” Each habit seems to loop back onto itself, influencing and being influenced by many other habits in complex, interrelated patterns. I see the same phenomenon at work with the people I teach and coach. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=868))
- the jobs that seem to best resist technological unemployment are those that involve building, maintaining, promoting, and defending a particular perspective. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1262))
- In the creativity-driven, exponentially changing world we live in, the opportunity cost of missing a note because it’s “in the wrong box” is simply too high. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1348))
- don’t pursue goals; instead create systems that encourage attractors to emerge on their own. With such a system in place, the more chaotic your environment, the more randomness and uncertainty you are exposed to, the faster you will be propelled to interesting places, as long as you’re open to wherever that may lead. ([Location 1570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1570))
- As the inimitable Venkatesh Rao has written, we’re moving from a world of containers (companies, departments, semesters, packages, silos) to a world of streams (social networks, info feeds, main streets of thriving cities, Twitter). Problems and opportunities alike resist having neat little boxes drawn around them. There’s way too much to absorb. Way too much to even guess what you don’t know. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1777))
- There’s another way to learn faster: assimilate and build on the ideas of others. Sure, you won’t understand every tacit lesson their experience gave them, but you can incorporate many of them, and in a fraction of the time it would take you to make every mistake yourself. ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=1796))
- the true purpose of note-taking is transporting states of mind (not just information) through time. ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2338))
- What I’m referring to here is multifinality. Whereas multitasking refers to seeking multiple outputs from multiple simultaneous inputs, and is impossible, multifinality refers to attaining alternative objectives from the same inputs, and is eminently possible. Can that ad campaign also be an opportunity to test the relative performance of different market segments? Can this presentation be recorded and used as a business development tool? Can captchas also be used to decipher street addresses? These questions allow you to kill two birds with one stone, each present self making life easier on multiple future selves in an expanding, branching tree of optionality. Crucially, multifinality doesn’t take more time or resources or effort — just a more diverse set of lenses to see that any action can have multiple non-exclusive outcomes. ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2359))
- “Employees work just enough to not be fired, and employers pay them just enough to not quit.” ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2407))
- Immersion means intentionally exposing yourself to streams of ideas, people, and new capabilities, not with the goal of knowing everything, but to stay sensitized to developing opportunities and threats. The faster the stream goes, the more ideas and information you get exposed to. Experimentation recognizes that our technological, networked world presents us with quickly falling downsides (for example, the cost of starting a business, or the costs of failure), as well as rapidly expanding upsides (opportunities to reach more people in less time than ever before). The only strategy that makes sense in such a situation is placing many small bets in many different directions, in hopes of riding the huge upside of any idea that happens to succeed. More experimentation leads to more failure, but that’s actually a good thing: the faster you fail, the faster you learn, because it is usually faster and cheaper to learn from failure than to attempt to anticipate and plan for every single thing that could go wrong. Leverage is the ability to rapidly shift resources to new, more fruitful directions. This ability becomes paramount when the best path forward cannot be predicted, and even when you find it, it can change quickly and unexpectedly. ([Location 2560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2560))
- Individuals and companies in this new era innovate by exposing themselves to as many different streams as possible, especially ones that provide: rich feedback self-correction ongoing improvement continuous learning ([Location 2598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2598))
- tinkering can equally be defined as “play,” and in this way it mimics the random walk of children’s games. This is an uncomfortable analogy in professional contexts (we don’t like the idea that we go to work to “play games”), but it reflects a historical insight: the future of work lies in today what we consider play. The well-paid virtual reality designers of today were the “video game addicts” of yesteryear. ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2620))
- “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works” ([Location 2671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2671))
- The hard truth is that no one really does anything they don’t enjoy for long. At most, they focus their efforts on finding the elusive intersection between what they enjoy and what they must do. ([Location 2824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2824))
- Disturbance propagation describes one way that emergent systems can change — by using an external disturbance as the “seed” of a new pattern, and propagating this new pattern across the rest of the system in a cascading sequence. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2917))
- There’s even evidence that emergent systems need chaos in order to form stable patterns. Habits seem to be little bubbles of structure in the midst of our chaotic lives; thus many habit formation theories emphasize controlling the environment and reducing variability in a bid to help these bubbles survive. ([Location 2934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2934))
- The reason lifestyle experimentation is so risky for individuals is that, unlike a company or a product, you can’t just fail fast, walk away, and try again. There is no exit — this is your life. Self-concepts are not easily disposable. ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2973))
- This irreproducibility suggests the importance of another form of psychological capital that is also highly correlated with successful behavior change: self-compassion. They are two sides to the same coin — you need self-efficacy to believe you can do it, but you equally need self-compassion to be ok when you don’t. ([Location 2991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=2991))
- Essentially, because habits are MVBs — Minimum Viable Behaviors. They have a clear beginning, middle, and end (cue, behavior, reward), making them easy to define and identify when they appear. ([Location 3027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3027))
- If “meta-learning” is learning how to learn, then meta-skills in this context involve “learning how to work.” Meta-skills are the skills you need to leverage other skills. ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3261))
- Is there any better definition of productivity? We learn meta-skills to perform higher-leverage work, but the best source of leverage is creating new constraints — new macro-laws. These macro-laws channel our energy more efficiently, giving us the surplus resources to acquire yet more skills. Improving one’s productivity is not a self-organizing process, but a self-simplifying one. ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3441))
