## Highlights
- The way to transcend karma lies in the proper use of the mind and the will. The oneness of all life is a truth that can be fully realized only when false notions of a separate self, whose destiny can be considered apart from the whole, are forever annihilated. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=161))
- Voidness is that which stands right in the middle between this and that. The void is all-inclusive, having no opposite — there is nothing which it excludes or opposes. It is living void, because all forms come out of it and whoever realizes the void is filled with life and power and the love of all beings. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=164))
- Art reaches its greatest peak when devoid of self-consciousness. Freedom discovers man the moment he loses concern over what impression he is making or about to make. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=186))
- Let yourself go with the disease, be with it, keep company with it — this is the way to be rid of it. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=197))
- Establish nothing in regard to oneself. Pass quickly like the non-existent and be quiet as purity. Those who gain lose. Do not precede others, always follow them. Do not run away; let go. Do not seek, for it will come when least expected. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=203))
- Art is an expression of life and transcends both time and space. We must employ our own souls through art to give a new form and a new meaning to nature or the world. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=226))
- An artist’s expression is his soul made apparent, his schooling, as well as his “cool” being exhibited. Behind every motion, the music of his soul is made visible. Otherwise, his motion is empty and empty motion is like an empty word — no meaning. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JPNIHQ&location=228))
- Art is the way to the absolute and to the essence of human life. The aim of art is not the one-sided promotion of spirit, soul and senses, but the opening of all human capacities — thought, feeling, will — to the life rhythm of the world of nature. So will the voiceless voice be heard and the self be brought into harmony with it. Artistic skill, therefore, does not mean artistic perfection. It remains rather a continuing medium or reflection of some step in psychic development, the perfection of which is not to be found in shape and form, but must radiate from the human soul.
