## Les 3 types de neurones 
There are three types of neurons: 
- **Sensory neurons** carry messages about sensory stimuli from our tissues and sensory organs to the brain and spinal cord (CNS). These are also called afferent neurons because the direction the message travels is toward the CNS.
	- **Exteroceptors** are sensory neurons that are stimulated by input that comes from outside your body. These include the following: Photoreceptors in the eyes Mechanoreceptors in the ears and vestibular mechanism Chemoreceptors in the nose and mouth Thermoreceptors in the skin Mechanoreceptors for touch and pressure in the skin ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=1222))
	- **Interoceptors** are sensory neurons that are stimulated by input that comes from inside your body, specifically the tissues not involved in volitional movement. These include mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and thermoreceptors in our visceral organs and blood vessels. Proprioceptors are sensory neurons that are stimulated by input created by our own volitional movement or potentially volitional movement, including movements that might be done unconsciously, such as balancing. Proprioceptive input comes from the mechanoreceptors in our skeletal muscles and tendons and the joint capsule and collateral ligaments.

	- **Thermoreceptors** are stimulated by changes in temperature and include sensory neurons with receptors in our skin and blood vessels. Chemoreceptors are stimulated by chemical changes both outside and inside our bodies. These include sensory neurons with receptors for the following: Odor (in the nose) Taste (in the mouth and lining of the gut) CO2 levels (in the walls of the blood vessels in the aorta and carotid arteries) Hormones (in the brain stem) Photoreceptors are stimulated by light and include receptors in our eyes. Nociceptors (pain receptors) are stimulated by intense and potentially damaging stimuli (pain) that might be mechanically, chemically, or thermally induced. It’s proposed that these sensory neurons can be found in many different tissues. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=1251))
- **Motor neurons** carry messages about what actions to take. These messages travel from the brain and spinal cord to the effector organs (mainly muscles and glands). These are also called efferent neurons because the direction the message travels is away from the CNS. 
- **Interneurons** carry messages between neurons; there are more interneurons than sensory and motor neurons, and they are all located in the central nervous system. Interneurons and glial cells create neural circuits and neural networks between sensory neurons, motor neurons, other interneurons, and other glial cells to support complex processes such as memory and learning.
