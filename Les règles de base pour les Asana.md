## Les règles de base pour les Asana
- A useful description of asana that Amy uses is “**a container for an experience**.” Asana is a form that we inhabit for a moment, a shape that we move into and out of, a place where we might choose to pause and pay attention differently in the continuously flowing movement of life. From this perspective, an asana is not an exercise for strengthening or stretching a particular muscle or muscle group, although it might have that effect.

- There really aren’t dangerous asana (or safe asana), just dangerous (or safe) ways of doing them. Any asana can be done safely or dangerously depending on how it’s taught, how it’s modified, the student’s experience and skill, and the movement potential of each person.

- Alignment is relational. Alignment is a relational term, not an absolute concept that exists without reference to something else. It describes a relationship with something, so we have to ask “Alignment with what?” ([Location 3077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=3077))
- No single alignment instruction will work for every person’s body. Standardized alignment instructions are often offered as ways to safely do an asana. One single instruction cannot cover all the ways that people can move into and out of an asana, and what is a helpful instruction for one person might be what injures someone else if it’s based on the assumption that our bodies are all the same.
