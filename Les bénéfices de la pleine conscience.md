## Les bénéfices de la pleine conscience
- Mindfulness is a form of bodymind training that has been demonstrated to dramatically reduce stress; increase feelings of calm, relation, and harmony; decrease feelings of anxiety and depression; reduce the discomfort of pain; lower blood pressure; increase learning capacity, IQ, and creativity; and awaken higher states of consciousness, sometimes called “the farther reaches of human nature.”3 It’s like a steroid for human activities in general, from the ordinary mundane to the enlightened spiritual. This powerful practice goes back at least 2,500 years, and humanity has continued to use it that long simply it because it works (it is a major ingredient in many of the paths of Waking Up).
