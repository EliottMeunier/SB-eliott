## Comment se séparer du vert et évoluer
- For the time being, let’s look at green pluralism or relativism (and start tracking these to see if any apply to you). First of all, it believes that there is nothing superior anywhere in the world; what’s true for a particular person is true for that person—you can’t go in and impose your beliefs on somebody, claiming that you are right and they are wrong. You have your truth, they have theirs, and that’s it. Likewise, all ranking, all hierarchies, are strictly taboo. What’s required are partnership societies, where all people—and especially all men and all women—are looked at equally. Even excellence and achievement—the hallmarks of the previous modern stage—are looked at suspiciously by green postmodernism, because that means you are making judgments about somebody being better or higher or more achieved than somebody else, and that is nothing but oppression. Meetings are considered a success, not if any conclusion is reached, but if everybody gets a chance to share their feelings; this tends to take forever, and few actual actions are taken. All previous approaches to a topic are considered essentially wrong, driven by oppression or patriarchy or sexism or racism or colonialism or imperialism, and green pluralism will redo all of this and do it right, based on pure equality, partnerships, and no ranking or hierarchical judging.

- And the new approach is not based on abstract rationality or logic, but is based on feelings and comes straight from the heart, not the head; thinking is out, feeling is in. The heart is the basis of all real truth, and it must be “embodied”—anchored in feelings, not thoughts. All the previous approaches are “old paradigm,” and this new approach is “new paradigm.” The old paradigm is rational, analytic, divisive, Newtonian-Cartesian, egocentric, Earth-hating and Earth-denying, sexist, racist, colonialist, built on rampant commercialism and profit/greed; whereas the new paradigm is congruent with the “new” physics (meaning quantum physics, which is actually a century old now), is eco-centric instead of egocentric; is built on partnership, caring, and loving-kindness, is holistic and organic (not fragmented and mechanistic), is congruent with systems theory; is feminist, Gaia-focused, Earth-centered, and glocal-oriented (meaning global and local).
