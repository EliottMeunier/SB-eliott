## L'idée fausse que les hommes imposent les hierarchies aux femmes
- Gilligan became famous for proposing, in her book In a Different Voice, that men and women reason differently—men with an emphasis on hierarchy and autonomy, and women with an emphasis on relationship and belonging. Feminists who believed that all hierarchies are bad jumped on Gilligan’s argument that men—not women—think hierarchically, and used it to blame men (and the patriarchy) for most of humanity’s ills. But these feminists, and postmodernists in general, studiously ignored a second point that Gilligan made in that book: namely, that both men and women develop through the same 4 basic hierarchical stages (her term). In women, Gilligan named these hierarchical levels as follows:  
- stage 1, or selfish—the woman cares only for herself (this is our egocentric); 
- stage 2, or care—the woman extends care from only herself to groups (our ethnocentric); 
- stage 3, or universal care—the woman extends care to all humans, regardless of race, color, sex, or creed (our worldcentric); 
- and stage 4, which she called integrated—where women and men integrate the other sex’s attitude (our integral). ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BMYXTU0&location=1280))
