## Comment accéder aux aspects non physiques de notre énergie ? 
- How do you access the non-physical aspect of your life energy? The yogic practices, which involve postures, breath, attitudes of the mind, and energy activation, **are all essentially oriented toward aligning the first three layers of the body: the physical, the mental, and the energetic body.** It is only in aligning them that you find access to dimensions beyond the physical—to the fundamental life energy itself.

- If you take the path of kriya, a certain fundamental discipline has to be brought into all physical, psychological, and emotional processes. **If you want to hit the peak of your consciousness, this discipline is essential**. You cannot be partying till early morning and attempt to scale Mount Everest tomorrow! The same logic holds true here.
