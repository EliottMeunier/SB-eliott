## Highlights
- In reality, the brain is brimming with activity everywhere, all the time. Even in the absence of any experimental task, there are dynamic fluctuations in metabolism all over the brain. Loads of research now supports the idea that these fluctuations are not just random noise, but rather that they carry information predictive of behavior and cognition.
- the conventional view is that networks are comprised of groups of modules, which are used to carry out specific types of tasks. The alternative, emerging view suggests that certain areas are correlated in time due to the phase and direction of propagating information.
