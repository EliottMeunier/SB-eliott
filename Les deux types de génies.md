## Les deux types de génies
1. Il est brillant mais ne peut pas transmettre son savoir, il est trop technique
2. Il est brillant et quand il te l'explique, il te fait sentir comme le génie. Il met de la clarté sur un truc que tu as toujours pensé ([[Elon Musk]])
Le deuxième type est celui qui gagne dans [[3 GARDEN/Notes/The Passion Economy]]

Someone once told me that there are two kinds of geniuses. One is the person who says things you could never have thought of and don’t fully understand after hearing them. That genius reveals the massive gulf between you and him or her. Albert Einstein describing his theory of relativity is the ultimate example. The other type of genius is a person who can take a jumble of confused thoughts and reassemble them so clearly, so simply, that it makes you feel as if you, yourself, are the genius, since you now fully understand something that was in there, in confused form, in your brain, all along. Scott Stern is that second kind of genius. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q231X35&location=280))
