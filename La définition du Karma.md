## La définition du Karma
Le Karma c'est la trace énergétique que tes décisions, actions et intentions laisse. On peut en être emprisonné si on ne les traite pas.

- What exactly is karma? “Karma” literally means “action.” Action is of three kinds. It could be in terms of the body, mind, or energy. **Whatever you do with your body, mind, or energy, leaves a certain residue.** This residue forms a pattern of its own, and these resultant patterns stay with you. When you gather a huge volume of impressions, slowly these shape themselves into tendencies, and you become like an automatic toy, **a slave to your patterns, a puppet of your past.** ([Location 2739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=2739))

- The very way the karmic structure works in every human being is essentially cyclical. If you observe very closely, within a day the same cycles are happening many times over. If you are very observant, you will see that every forty minutes you are going through a physiological cycle. **Once you see that, then with the necessary attention and awareness you can ride the cycle and move toward transcendence from the limitations that these cycles set**. So, every forty minutes, life presents you with an opportunity—the opportunity to become conscious. Every forty to forty-eight minutes, there is also a shift of dominance in the way the breath is moving through the right and left nostrils. It is dominant in the right nostril for a length of time, and then in the left. Become aware of this so you know at least something about you is changing. This awareness can be further enhanced into awareness of the solar and lunar influences upon the body. If you bring your physical system in sync with the lunar and solar cycles, your physical and psychological health is guaranteed.

La nature du mental est cyclique. On peut apporter de la conscience pour transcender cette cyclicité.
