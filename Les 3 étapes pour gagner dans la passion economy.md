## Les 3 étapes pour gagner dans la passion economy
1. Définir comment on crée de la valeur
2. Définir pour qui on la crée
3. Définir contre quelle est notre compétition

- Step one: understanding how your business adds and captures value. This crucial step is worth elaborating on. Think of any business that has a shot at success. Someone is doing something that creates value. 
- The second step is to pick your customer. This might seem odd. One would think that either customers show up or they don’t. But Scott points out that customers are not one undifferentiated mass of identical people. They have different interests, different levels of hunger for your product or service. A business needs to identify the customers it wants, and it should figure out who wants its product enough that it can charge whatever it needs to in order to make the business sustainable.

- The third step, the one that Scott says most people find confusing, is to pick your competition. How can you pick who you’ll compete with? Scott points out that every company has a variety of options in the ways they take their product or service to market. Eitan, again, provides an example. He framed his entire sneaker business around Nike. He talked about Nike. He designed the shoes to look a bit like Nikes. He ordered them from the same factory Nike used. He felt Nike was his competition. That meant that people saw his shoes as cheap Nike knockoffs, and nobody wants to buy cheap Nike knockoffs. He could have chosen a different competitor—for example, the lousiest of discount sneakers. He could then have argued that his product was more durable, more stylish, better performing than the bottom of the barrel. By choosing that competitor and framing his business around capturing its share of the market, he would then have had an easier time seeing his subsequent choices. He would have needed a low-margin, high-volume business strategy. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q231X35&location=599))

- the crucial Passion Economy question: What is the value I am creating that is beyond that of similar businesses or services, and who am I creating it for? ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q231X35&location=869))
