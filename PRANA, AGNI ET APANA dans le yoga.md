## PRANA, AGNI ET APANA dans le yoga
**Prana** is about what brings raw materials into the system, **agni** is about turning those raw materials into nourishment, and **apana** is about eliminating whatever is unneeded. 

- The Sanskrit term prana is derived from pra-, a prefix meaning “before,” and an, a verb meaning “to breathe, to blow, and to live.” Prana refers to what nourishes a living thing, but it has also come to mean the action that brings in the nourishment. Within this chapter, **the term will refer to the functional life processes of a single entity**. When capitalized, Prana is a more universal term that can be used to designate the manifestation of all generative life force.

- The raw materials that enter a living thing must be processed and metabolized, and that faculty is the domain of agni, fire. Within our body, agni is associated with the digestive fire, and in general with our ability to metabolize and assimilate anything that can nourish us on any level.

- Fire produces ash, and metabolism produces waste. **Apana**, which is derived from apa, meaning “away,” “off,” or “down,” refers to the waste that’s being eliminated as well as the action of elimination. ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=2129))
