## Highlights
- The levels of processing model (Craik & Lockhart, 1972) focuses on the depth of processing involved in memory, and predicts the deeper information is processed, the longer a memory trace will last. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444433233/17455302))
- Levels of processing: The idea that the way information is encoded affects how well it is remembered. The deeper the level of processing, the easier the information is to recall. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444433233/17455377))
- We can process information in 3 ways: ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444433233/17455379))
- Shallow Processing
  - This takes two forms
  1. Structural processing (appearance) which is when we encode only the physical qualities of something. E.g. the typeface of a word or how the letters look.
  2. Phonemic processing – which is when we encode its sound.
  Shallow processing only involves maintenance rehearsal (repetition to help us hold something in the STM) and leads to fairly short-term retention of information. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444433233/17455381))
- Deep Processing
  - This takes two forms
  3. Semantic processing, which happens when we encode the meaning of a word and relate it to similar words with similar meaning.
  Deep processing involves elaboration rehearsal which involves a more meaningful analysis (e.g. images, thinking, associations etc.) of information and leads to better recall. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444433233/17455387))
- This explanation of memory is useful in everyday life because it highlights the way in which elaboration, which requires deeper processing of information, can aid memory. Three examples of this are.
  • Reworking – putting information in your own words or talking about it with someone else.
  • Method of loci – when trying to remember a list of items, linking each with a familiar place or route.
  • Imagery – by creating an image of something you want to remember, you elaborate on it and encode it visually (i.e. a mind map). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444433233/17455391))
