If you have a car, drive into the parking at the back of the building (5 Grey Street, Woodstock, 7915) as if you were going to the shops (spar etc.) and park. As you enter the lobby of the building from the parking there is a bank of lock boxes on the wall. Locate lockbox SIXTY 1 and use code 9211 to open the box and retrieve keys to 627. Please close and scramble the code. Your keys and the door handle to the apartment have been sanitized. 

Once you have the keys you can proceed into the lift lobby which is just inside the building on your left through a class door. Use the tag to get through the doors. Once in the elevator, use the tag to tap the small black box next to the lift numbers so that it shows a green light, then press 6 to take you to floor 6. At floor 6 exit the elevator turn right and proceed to the end of the corridor on your right to door 627.

You may need to sign in and show your booking confirmation with the building security. Once you have retrieved the tag you can drive to the second floor (via second boom) and park in bay P243 on the right of the elevator lobby.
