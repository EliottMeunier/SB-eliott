## L'enseignement dans le partage la compassion et l'amour Svādhyāya
- Svādhyāya is different from mere instruction like attending a lecture where the lecturer parades his own learning before the ignorance of his audience. When people meet for svādhyāya, the speaker and listener are of one mind and have mutual love and respect. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=600))
- The person practising svādhyāya reads his own book of life, at the same time that he writes and revises it. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=604))
