## Le chemin de la libération est la compassion et l'aide aux autres 
- To overcome the obstacles and to win unalloyed happiness, Patañjali offered several remedies. The best of these is the fourfold remedy of Maitri (friendliness), Karuṇa (compassion), Muditā (delight) and Upekṣā (disregard). ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=363))
- It is compassion coupled with devoted action to relieve the misery of the afflicted. The yogi uses all his resources – physical, economic, mental or moral – to alleviate the pain and suffering of others. He shares his strength with the weak until they become strong. He shares his courage with those that are timid until they become brave by his example. He denies the maxim of the ‘survival of the fittest’, but makes the weak strong enough to survive. He becomes a shelter to one and all. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=368))
- The yogi understands the faults of others by seeing and studying them first in himself. This self-study teaches him to be charitable to all. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=377))
- The śiṣya should above all treasure love, moderation and humility. Love begets courage, moderation creates abundance and humility generates power. Courage without love is brutish. Abundance without moderation leads to over-indulgence and decay. Power without humility breeds arrogance and tyranny.
