## Highlights
- The multi-store model is an explanation of memory proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin which assumes there are three unitary (separate) memory stores, and that information is transferred between these stores in a linear sequence.
  The three main stores are the sensory memory, short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM).
  Each of the memory stores differs in the way information is processed (encoding), how much information can be stored (capacity), and for how long (duration).
  Information passes from store to store in a linear way, and has been described as an information processing model (like a computer) with an input, process and output.
  Information is detected by the sense organs and enters the sensory memory, which stores a fleeting impression of sensory stimuli. If attended to this information enters the STM and if the information is given meaning (elaborative rehearsal) it is passed on to the LTM ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455402))
- Encoding is the way information is changed so that it can be stored in the memory. There are three main ways in which information can be encoded (changed):
  1. visual (picture),
  2. acoustic (sound),
  3. semantic (meaning). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455406))
- Sensory Memory
  • Capacity: all sensory experience (v. larger capacity)
  • Encoding: sense specific (e.g. different stores for each sense)
  The sensory stores are constantly receiving information but most of this receives no attention and remains in the sensory register for a very brief period. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455409))
- Attention is the first step in remembering something, if a person’s attention is focused on one of the sensory stores then the data is transferred to STM. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455410))
- Short Term Memory
  • Duration: 0-18 seconds
  • Capacity: 7 +/- 2 items
  • Encoding: mainly auditory
  The STM store has a duration of up to 30 seconds, has a capacity of 7+/-2 chunks and mainly encodes information acoustically. Information is lost through displacement or decay.
  Maintenance rehearsal is the process of verbally or mentally repeating information, which allows the duration of short-term memory to be extended beyond 30 seconds. An example of maintenance rehearsal would be remembering a phone number only long enough to make the phone call. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455411))
- If maintenance rehearsal (repetition) does not occur, then information is forgotten, and lost from short term memory through the processes of displacement or decay. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455413))
- Long Term Memory
  • Duration: Unlimited
  • Capacity: Unlimited
  • Encoding: Mainly Semantic (but can be visual and auditory)
  The LTM has unlimited capacity and duration and encodes information semantically. Information can be recalled from LTM back into the STM when it is needed.
  If the information is given meaning (elaborative rehearsal) it is passed on to the LTM.
  Elaborative rehearsal involves the process of linking new information in a meaningful way with information already stored in long-term memory. For example, you could learn the lines in a play by relating the dialogue and behavior of your character to similar personal experiences you remember.
  Elaborative rehearsal is more effective than maintenance rehearsal for remembering new information as it helps to ensure that information is encoded well. It is a deeper level of information-processing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1444437398/17455414))
