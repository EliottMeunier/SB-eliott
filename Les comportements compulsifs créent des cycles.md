## Les comportements compulsifs créent des cycles
- If you are compulsive, you will see that situations, experiences, thoughts, and emotions in your life will be in cycles. They keep coming back to you once every six or eighteen months, three years, or six years, depending on your degree of compulsiveness. If you just look back on your life, you will notice this. If they come once every twelve years, that means your system is in a high state of receptivity and balance. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=1471))
