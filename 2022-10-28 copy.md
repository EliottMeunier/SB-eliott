I spent 3 days in Marianne, a small wine estate in South Africa.
When I cam, I had no idea what U was about to discover,
But I slowly realized that I was not visiting a company,
But a real family.
I saw some amazing human beings, just laughing as if none of their troubles were existing,
They showed me their processes, and I understood that it is not about producing, it is about creating.
When wine becomes poetry when discribed,
When a real symphony is playing when in mouth,
