## Image pour décrire les états méditatifs
- When oil is poured from one vessel to another, one can observe the steady constant flow. When the flow of concentration is uninterrupted, the state that arises is dhyāna (meditation). ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=863))
- Samādhi is the end of the sādhaka’s quest. At the peak of his meditation, he passes into the state of samādhi, where his body and senses are at rest as if he is asleep, his faculties of mind and reason are alert as if he is awake, yet he has gone beyond consciousness. The person in a state of samādhi is fully conscious and alert. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=880))
