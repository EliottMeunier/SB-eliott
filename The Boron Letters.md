By the way, remember yesterday when I asked you to get a copy of "The Joy Of Running"? Well, here are two other books you should look for: "The Miracle of Fasting" by Paul Bragg and "Are You Confused?" by Paulo Airola.
LOCATION: 270

My dad’s favorite saying was “nothing is impossible for a man who refuses to listen to reason,” and it served him well his whole life.
LOCATION: 319

nay-Sayers.
LOCATION: 323

When it comes to accomplishing things, most people fail to even try.
LOCATION: 324

There is no benefit in dealing with people who have nothing but negative things to say. When that someone amounts to just about everyone, just keep it to yourself.
LOCATION: 325

the Australian doctor who discovered a non-surgical cure for ulcers. Everyone in the scientific community agreed that no viruses or anything could live in the acidic conditions inside the human stomach. He spent a LOT of time trying to convince other doctors he was right. Finally, he ignored all of them and went about his research and proved that most ulcers are caused by organisms in the stomach.
LOCATION: 326

He Had To Treat & Cure Several People Before The Medical Community Would Pay Attention To Him!
LOCATION: 330

But he sure would have saved a lot of time by not bothering to argue and just finishing his work.
LOCATION: 332

No, sometimes there is no use wasting time and energy fighting established beliefs by arguing, and it is better to just silently go about proving or accomplishing your goal.
LOCATION: 336

not to rely on anyone is a whole lesson all by itself.
LOCATION: 422

When most people tell others of any plan to make money, they are met with instant negativity. Once you set out to actually do something which may elevate your status, many people will tell you it can’t be done, it isn’t worth it, or remind you of all the pitfalls they can think of.
LOCATION: 424

don’t care what you think of your friends or family, it is in most people’s nature to stop you.
LOCATION: 427

Again, people don’t do this consciously. It’s simply a self-defense mechanism to make themselves feel better because   The Idea of You Getting Rich Makes Most People Around You Feel Sick!
LOCATION: 429

Let’s face it, most people judge how well they have done in life by comparing themselves to their peers, and if one of their peers has become a multi-millionaire and could retire young and rich, then they will have to question their own choices.
LOCATION: 438

The other point which I feel can be made now is that he repeats himself often. This is not absent mindedness and is 100% intentional.
LOCATION: 453

that he must continue to think about and go over their plans for the future.
LOCATION: 457

Write down your goals and go over them every day, not just once a year.
LOCATION: 460

DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR INVITES AGGRESSIVE ACTION
LOCATION: 478

there is very little sympathy for a weakling.
LOCATION: 479

rely on your own strength instead of somebody else's compassion!
LOCATION: 495

No, the real trick is to cut out those that hold you back.
LOCATION: 549

Carry yourself with confidence (not arrogance) in everything you do and people will respond in a good way.
LOCATION: 574

when someone asks me what is the #1 big secret to making money, I tell them they should get involved in whatever excites them the most.
LOCATION: 583

Money, in my opinion, especially big money, is most often a by-product of enthusiasm.
LOCATION: 584

Always look for the most enthusiastic person, not necessarily the most qualified.
LOCATION: 587

Now, pay attention. The very first thing you must come to realize is that you must become a "student of markets." Not products. Not techniques. Not copywriting. Not how to buy space or whatever. Now, of course, all of these things are important and you must learn about them, but, the
LOCATION: 597

first and the most important thing you must learn is what people want to buy.
LOCATION: 598

And it's easy. You see, the way to deduce what people want to buy is to simply observe what they DO buy!
LOCATION: 600

top notch marketing man, you have to know how it is. How it really is. Not how people (or you) wish it was or how they think it is. No. You must become a "student of reality."
LOCATION: 624

What I am trying to teach you here is to constantly be on the lookout for groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving (or at least hungry!) for some particular product or service.
LOCATION: 676

THE BEST LIST OF ALL IS YOUR OWN CUSTOMER LIST!
LOCATION: 755

nothing will add to your bottom line as fast as selling something new to your existing customers and sourcing new prospects.
LOCATION: 763

Sell People What They Want To Buy!
LOCATION: 829

Now one thing I haven't mentioned so far is that you want to be on the lookout for ads and direct mail pieces that you see over and over. What this means is that whomever is running the ad has hit a nerve. And, a good way for you to make money is for you to hit that same nerve, only do it better.
LOCATION: 831

Once I asked at class at USC how many of them preferred to go to plays more than movies. Lots of people raised their hands. "Bull!" I said to them. "You are all fooling yourselves, and I'm going to prove it." I then asked for a show of hands of those people who had seen a play in the last week or so. No hands. I then asked to see the hands of people who had seen a movie in the last week or so. Many hands.
LOCATION: 889

We often try to convince others and ourselves that we are something we are not, something we have an idea we "should" be. Therefore, truth, my good son, can be determined NOT by how people use their mouths, but rather, how they use their wallets.
LOCATION: 896

making offers to people who are at an emotional turning point in their lives.
LOCATION: 907

As a general rule, the more "custom tailored" your promotion, is the more successful it will be.
LOCATION: 1017

Ideas breed other ideas.
LOCATION: 1039

It doesn't work that way. Not often anyway. The key is movement!
LOCATION: 1068

let's start by getting his attention. And intriguing the heck out of him right from the start.
LOCATION: 1244

Do you see how this type of personal, specific info bonds the reader and writer closer together? You do? Good. I'll continue.
LOCATION: 1305

It seems like a small point and, maybe it is, but is the little touches like this that keeps the letter flowing, the reader moving along, and, it relieves him of the burden of trying to figure out what he is supposed to do when he finishes reading a particular page. Don't

and so, Mr. Jones, as you can see, what I am offering you is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a piece of a legalized Nevada whorehouse. I hope you can take advantage of this offer. But, if you can't, would you please drop me a note and tell you can't participate at this time. That way I'll feel free to make this exciting offer to someone else. I've enclosed a self-addressed envelope and I have even put a stamp on it because (either way) it is important that I hear from you right away. Please, please -- reply today!
LOCATION: 1380

First of all, it's not just a guilt inducer, it also develops a strong selling point: Namely, the selling point of this being a genuine limited offer that some other lucky person will take advantage of it you don't. And, the stamped envelope tends to "credential" that point. (I just made a noise and my little bunny slipped away.) Here's something else: If you can get a person who is not going to order to agree, in his mind, to write and tell you he is not going to, then you will get more orders.
LOCATION: 1387

keep on keeping on. Here is a trick to doing so. Keep two task lists. The first list is of every important thing you really should do while at your best. My distraction-free creative time is in the morning when I do most of my writing, editing or consulting, because it’s when I am reliably at my best. The second list is of all the important tasks which I can do equally well regardless of my mood.
LOCATION: 1445

Dear Mr. Tiberion,   I am attaching a plastic baggie to the top of this letter for two important reasons:   First of all, what I have to say to you is very serious and I needed some way to be sure to get your attention.   And secondly, what is inside that baggie could very well be your passport to complete financial independence!   Why is this? The answer is simple: You see, what is inside that baggie is a very tiny amount of what is the most valuable thing on earth.   I'm talking about real estate and, in this case, Hawaiian Real Estate!   Yes, it's true. The sand inside that baggie was taken directly from a certain beach on the island of

You see, what I did is I got his attention and then I tied my copy to my "attention grabber" in a relevant way that makes sense.

picture with pleasure" that beach in his mind.
LOCATION: 1508

don't want him to realize that I want to sell him something until I am well into my pitch. Here is something else you should know: Many people, when they read an ad, read it like this... What they do is, they read the headline first and then they go right to the order coupon.

make it easy to order
LOCATION: 1555

your attempts to stand out, try and fight any urge to sound like a cliché and use phrases which a reader could finish on their own.
LOCATION: 1564

You only want the reader or viewer to get that head-nodding “been there, done that” feeling when you already got the prospect’s attention.
LOCATION: 1566

when you are finished with the copy dump, look for adjectives and things you can punch up on your list without sounding like a clown.
LOCATION: 1586

Describe what it looks like when happy customers receive the benefit of your product.
LOCATION: 1589

For example, phrases like, “My clients wake up all excited and can’t wait for the morning because………… they love to sip coffee while opening their email to see how much money they made while sleeping.”
LOCATION: 1590

Excessively talking about yourself, overly busy webpages, unexpected auto-playing videos and so forth give most everybody that oh yuck feeling but…
LOCATION: 1596

The main point is to disguise your pitch until you want the prospect to know you are selling something, and you can do this online to great effect.   Readers of snail mail do the same thing with websites and emails... they scroll right to the bottom.   Most marketers add a buy button to the bottom of their page, but instead of saying BUY, you might want to try adding my father’s text or simply use the word “Next.”
LOCATION: 1598

The first thing you need to do is to assemble a file that contains everything you can get your hands on that is relevant to your promotion. Here are some of the things that might be included in your file:
LOCATION: 1625

OK now, after you have assembled all this stuff, what you need to do is start reading and taking notes.
LOCATION: 1636

A complete description of your product including how many pages, how many words, how many photos, who wrote it, facts about the author (his age, background, success stories, etc.). You should also take notes on what this product will do for you. Will it make you wealthy? How will more money help your customer? Will he be able to buy a better car? Take more vacations? Afford a better home? If so, put it down. OK
LOCATION: 1659

what I want you to do is re-read the notes and the really good ones, put a star * beside them. And the ones that are even better put two stars ** next to
LOCATION: 1666

As I was saying, sometimes your breakthrough idea or “aha experience” will be a way to get attention like my baggie idea, or a new way to help the prospect visualize the benefits of owning what you have to sell, or a new order generating sales point or whatever. Anyway, at this point you now need to begin writing your letter according to formula.
LOCATION: 1678

By formula, I mean you should work within a proven sequential outline like AIDA.
LOCATION: 1683

What does AIDA stand for? It stands for ATTENTION, INTEREST, DESIRE, ACTION. So, to make it clearer your letter should: 1. First, get his attention 2. Second, get him interested 3. Third, make him desire what you are selling 4. Compel him to take whatever action is needed to get whatever it is you are selling.
LOCATION: 1684

the copy is only about you in so much as it proves how you can help the prospect solve their problems.
LOCATION: 1714

Attention comes first. Naturally, we must get our readers attention before he can become interested in and desirous of our offer. Getting attention is CRUCIAL. If you don’t get it, your letter or advertisement will never be read.
LOCATION: 1721

angry and probably won’t become a customer. So, always remember that your attention grabber needs to be relevant. It needs to tie in naturally with your letter.
LOCATION: 1727

let’s start by feeding him interesting facts. Like how much money there is to be made by investing in Maui real estate. By telling how much sand (cubic tons) is on the beach where we got the sand in that baggie. By telling how this is one of the best beach front investment opportunities in Maui. By telling how many pretty girls there are around. By telling the specific kinds of fish you can catch right off the beach. Etc.
LOCATION: 1736

What we do to create desire is we describe the benefits our prospect gets if he buys our product or service. Now, in the case of an investment-orientated offer, what we have to offer is the prospect of making money. At least this is our main attraction.
LOCATION: 1746

So, what's let's do is let’s help him to picture in his mind the benefits of having more money. Don’t think it’s not necessary. Remember, you must always do even the obvious. Here then, are some benefits of having more money: New car - impress your friends and family, ride in comfort and luxury Nice house - comfort, luxury, and status Peace of mind - no worries about bills or financial emergencies Vacations - money lets you travel the world, go where you want when you want
LOCATION: 1749

Attract the opposite sex - money, as any fool knows, makes you much more attractive to the opposite sex - it gives you more opportunities to meet them in nice places also Leisure time - money buys time: perhaps the best reason of all for having fun goes
LOCATION: 1759

“Would you like to get in on this great investment opportunity? Would you like to be one of the privileged few who actually own a piece of the finest beach in Maui? If so, it’s easy to order. All you have to do is fill out the order coupon and send it to me with your payment, etc.,
LOCATION: 1767

I want to stress is that you must be very clear, very specific about what you want him to do. Lead him by the hand and take him exactly where you want him to go. Tell him where the order coupon is. Tell him to fill it out. Tell him to enclose the payment. Tell him how much to send.
LOCATION: 1770

And, above all, tell him to do all this RIGHT NOW! TODAY!
LOCATION: 1774

Another simple way to get a reader interested is to tell their story by telling your story with the problem your solution solves.
LOCATION: 1794

My teenage kids were acting out and it felt like there wasn’t enough time in the day to be a good parent. Then I discovered a 40-page book which changed everything.
LOCATION: 1797

This book shows you how to benefit, benefit, benefit.
LOCATION: 1799

As part of your nugget notes, describe the benefits emotionally.
LOCATION: 1806

You may swap “you will be able to choose what to do with your day” with “you will have the freedom to choose what to do with your day.”

When you write bullets…the basic pattern should be specific/blind fact, benefit.

There is no need to struggle making these full sentences. Abbreviate whenever possible.

Use simple common everyday words. Use “get” instead of “procure.” Write short sentences and short paragraphs. Use “transition” words and phrases to make your writing flow smoothly. Do you notice how I use transition words and phrases such as the following?
LOCATION: 1876

Ask questions once in a while and then answer them yourself. Like this: Bond, do you understand what I am saying? You do. Good, then let’s go on. Etc.

do you notice how little one word transition sentences like “onward.” keep the flow going?

“And, just wait until you step into that warm, inviting Jacuzzi that comes with every apartment. Man oh man! The feel of that soothing bubbling water against your bare skin is just plain heaven.” “You’ve heard of the expression about how you won’t believe your eyes? Well, this is one time you won’t believe your eyes. No kidding. The delightful aroma of these charcoal broiled steaks will remind you how good it feels to be genuinely hungry”
LOCATION: 1915

You can make your copy easier to read by the judicious use of parentheses. For example, if you want to tell people that your offer is good anywhere in the U.S. (except Alaska) the proper use of parentheses, as I just did, makes the copy easier-to-read,
LOCATION: 1925

Now, listen up. When a person first looks at something you have written it should be something that looks inviting to read. Easy-to-read. When he looks at your page of copy he should be drawn to your copy like a convict is to a Penthouse Magazine.

When a person goes for a job interview, the interviewer decides whether or not to hire that person in the first 40-seconds.

And this: When a person falls in love, it happens almost instantaneously. After that, minor things like the truth about the newly beloved are cast aside unless those "truths" happen to reinforce the wonderfulness of said love subject. And this: You either hook a reader or lose him when he very first looks at your ad or DM piece. Not when he reads it, but when he first looks at it.
LOCATION: 2065

Most of the time, a person will never alter his original impression.
LOCATION: 2074

You see, I believe the "sale" or "no sale" decision is largely made the instant a prospect sees your ad and reads your headline.
LOCATION: 2092

think that if your prospect gets an instant "lift" from just looking at your ad, then he will start reading it and looking for reasons to convince himself that the promise of your ad is true!
LOCATION: 2094

But I think one thing that helps is if your promotion has a "crisp" look about it. In other words, the layout should be clean, there should be a lot of contrast, and it should look easy and inviting to read.

By the way, before I forget one little-known fact that is kind of interesting, women like to see pictures of women in ads and men like to see pictures of men.

Propositions are very important. They are the "deal" you are offering. For example: One deal might be that if you buy one item you get another item free.
LOCATION: 2217

and a very important ingredient in making your propositions work is the "reason why."
LOCATION: 2228

"Have I got a deal for you!" you need an explanation as to why you are offering this good deal.
LOCATION: 2229

Anyway, a couple paragraphs back I wrote: "and if you can find a way to use it, you can dramatically increase your sales volume." Now, compare that to this: "and if you can find a way to use it, you can make yourself a bushel of money!" Isn’t that a lot more powerful? You bet! The words “dramatically increase your sales volume” do not even begin to conjure up the visual imagery of “a bushel of money.”

Step 1 - Find a hot market (mailing list) Step 2 - Find or create a product (preferably paper and ink) to sell to that market. Step 3 - Create a direct mail promotion that describes the product (or service) and the benefits of owning the same. Step 4 - Make a test mailing (1,000 to 5,000 pieces) Step 5 - Analyze results Step 6 - If results are good, mail 20,000 to 100,000 more letters Step 7 - If results are still good, start rolling out and taking care of business You

The mistake is finding or developing a product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This is backasswards. You Must Always Find A Market First... And Then Concentrate On A Product!

Now, I'm going to talk to you about a big difference between people who make it in any field (including crime) and those who do not. That difference is awareness. Most people (at least many) walk around with their heads in the sand.

One way to increase believability is to give exact details. Instead of "most car owners" write "77.6% of all car owners". Instead of "you can lose lots of weight" write "and the average reported weight loss over a 31-day period was 37.5 pounds for men and 26.3 pounds for women".

I like to offer video testimonials whenever possible, and I will write out the main thing I want them to hear in a quote directly below the video like so.

“… Bond’s advice doubled my profits!”   This way, readers don’t even have to look at the video to get the main point, and the fact that the video is there adds more believability than static testimonials.

This was a first class letter that was designed to raise funds for a children's hospital. When the recipient opened the envelope, he discovered a personal, typed letter with a real, honest-to-goodness dollar bill attached to it. The copy explained that the writer wanted to donate a thousand dollars to a certain children's hospital, but that he realized that a thousand dollars wouldn't go very far. So, what he (the writer) had decided to do was divide his $1,000.00 contribution into 1,000 - one dollar bills and then mail these bills to 1,000 different people. Now, he went on to say, what he hoped is that everybody who received one of these dollar bills would decide not to keep it and, instead, send it straight to the hospital with one or more dollars of their own. Did it work? Oh my! It was probably the most effective direct mail promotion ever mailed. It got better than a 90% response, and the people to whom it was mailed eventually contributed tens of millions of dollars!
LOCATION: 2559

The message is clear: You must not use "cheap tricks." Make what you attach to the letter "fit in." All it takes is a little imagination. Let's see if I can come up with a couple of original examples:
