## Highlights
- Be clear about the Purpose
  Understand the purpose of having a Minimum Viable Day and keep this in mind AT ALL TIMES.
  Here are some key qualities that make up the MVD :
  Delivers some value = Achieve some small things that count as a win. Gain some rest time.
  Lean = Do the absolute minimum. Prioritisation is key (see below)
  Shipped = Do the day and get through it. Don’t give up.
  Insightful = Use it as a learning exercise. Be curious, even if you don’t feel like doing much else. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416150929/16531081))
- prioritising your deliverables in the MVD. Using the MoSCoW principle is the key to success here. MoSCoW stands for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t have. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416150929/16531086))
- 3. Postpone anything that can be done tomorrow
  As mentioned above, it’s important to be clear about what can be postponed to another day. For high performers like yourself, this might feel a bit uncomfortable. But remember — we’re on an MVD here.
  What can I do tomorrow / next week for when I gave regained my energy?
  Who do I need to be honest with about how I’m feeling today, so that they help me move a few things off my plate?
  Who could stand in for me?
  What can be binned off all together that I shouldn’t have been doing anyway ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416150929/16531089))
- Measure Performance based on your original objectives
  Do not be tempted to measure your day based on different success measurements to the ones you set out:
  Did I do the day?
  Did I not kill anyone?
  Do I feel ok?
  Can I do tomorrow? (i.e did the product — you — not fully break and fall over so that we can iterate tomorrow?) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1416150929/16531092))
