## La société n'est pas faite pour rendre les gens heureux
We grow up believing that what counts most in our lives is that which will occur in the future. “We are always getting to live,” as Ralph Waldo Emerson used to say, “but never living.”

As Freud and many others before and after him have noted, civilization is built on the repression of individual desires. It would be impossible to maintain any kind of social order, any complex division of labor, unless society’s members were forced to take on the habits and skills that the culture required, whether the individuals liked it or not.
