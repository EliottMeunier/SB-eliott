## Le problème que l'on rencontre avec la compréhension des énergies subtiles 
- The problem here might be stated as follows. Given (1) the premodern
  lack of clarity about the role of matter, and (2) the fact that the ancients
  therefore pictured subtle energies as fundamentally meta-physical or
  super-natural; but given (3) the modern understanding of matter as not
  bottom but exterior, then (4) how can we re-interpret in a more adequate fashion the relation of subtle energies to gross material forms? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtxcdaq5hq076yjd2d112j))

#### L'incompréhension des sociétés prémodernes
- Thus, what the premodern sages took to be META-physical realities are
  in many cases INTRA-physical realities: they are not above matter, nor
  beyond nature, nor meta-physical, nor super-natural: they are not above
  nature but within nature, not beyond matter but interior to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdr3v5aztm0venqz2pjy8kq)

#### La shadow du postmodernisme
Le postmodernisme est très souvent dans l'analyse du quadrant inférieur droit et ne voit le monde qu'à partir de ce monde là. 
- Postmodernism, on the other hand, is known for focusing on those
  interior or cultural aspects of an individual’s being-in-the-world, where
  it emphasizes that much of what any society takes to be “given,” “true,”
  and “absolute” is in fact culturally molded, conditioned, and relative.
  That postmodernism itself is often caught in its own quadrant ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtrcdh4j1341r5y8hpx2xw))
- (where it tries to reduce everything to cultural constructions
  in the LL) should not detract from the important truths that it has
  contributed—all of which we summarize by saying that every occasion
  has a Lower-Left quadrant or dimension. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdtrwqzx1xecwz2akhhnjw9))
