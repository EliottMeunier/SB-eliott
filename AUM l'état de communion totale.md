## AUM l'état de communion totale
- Aum: According to Śri Vinobā Bhāve, the Latin word Omne and the Sanskrit word Aum are both derived from the same root meaning all and both words convey the concepts of omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=825))
- The symbol AUM is composed of three syllables, namely the letters A, U, M, and when written has a crescent and dot on its top. A few instances of the various interpretations given to it may be mentioned here to convey its meaning. The letter A symbolises the conscious or waking state (jāgrata-avasthā), the letter U the dream state (svapna-avasthā) and the letter M the dreamless sleep state (suṣupta-avasthā) of the mind and spirit. The entire symbol, together with the crescent and the dot, stands for the fourth state (turīya-avasthā), which combines all these states and transcends them. This is the state of samādhi.
