## La capacité de traitement de notre système nerveux
On a 7 slots de mémoire à court terme qui changent toutes les 1/18s donc ça fait 1/2 million par heure. On sélectionne ce qu'on stocke grâce à l'attention. Notre vie est faite de tous ces slots et c'est donc notre attention et où on décide de la placer qui définie la qualité de notre vie.

The nervous system has definite limits on how much information it can process at any given time. ([[Les 7 slots de la mémoire à court terme]])
It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information—such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or recognizable nuances of emotion or thought—at any one time, and that the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and another is about 1/18 of a second. By using these figures one concludes that it is possible to process at most 126 bits of information per second, or 7,560 per minute, or almost half a million per hour. Over a lifetime of seventy years, and counting sixteen hours of waking time each day, this amounts to about 185 billion bits of information. It is out of this total that everything in our life must come—every thought, memory, feeling, or action. It seems like a huge amount, but in reality it does not go that far.
through the course of evolution the nervous system has become adept at “chunking” bits of information so that processing capacity is constantly expanded.

The process called attention. It is attention that selects the relevant bits of information from the potential millions of bits available.
The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life.
Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable.
Because attention determines what will or will not appear in consciousness, and because it is also required to make any other mental events—such as remembering, thinking, feeling, and making decisions—happen there, it is useful to think of it as psychic energy.
