## Les 8 limbs du yoga
- 1. Yama (universal moral commandments); 
- 2. Niyama (self purification by discipline); 
- 3. Āsana (posture); 
- 4. Prāṇāyāma (rhythmic control of the breath); 
- 5. Pratyāhāra (withdrawal and emancipation of the mind from the domination of the senses and exterior objects); 
- 6. Dhāraṇā (concentration); 
- 7. Dhyāna (meditation) and 
- 8. Samādhi (a state of superconsciousness brought about by profound meditation, in which the individual aspirant (sādhaka) becomes one with the object of his meditation – Paramātmā or the Universal Spirit). ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=266))
- Dhāraṇā, Dhyāna and Samādhi take the yogi into the innermost recesses of his soul. The yogi does not look heavenward to find God. He knows that HE is within, being known as the Antarātmā (the Inner Self). ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09WK1DZ1M&location=274))
- Mind is the king of the senses. One who has conquered his mind, senses, passions, thought and reason is a king among men. He is fit for Rāja Yoga, the royal union with the Universal Spirit. He has Inner Light. He who has conquered his mind is a Rāja Yogi. The word rāja means a king. The expression Rāja Yoga implies a complete mastery of the Self.
