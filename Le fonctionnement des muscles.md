## Le fonctionnement des muscles
- Muscles work together in complex ways. There’s not a right muscle for any joint action, but a whole assortment of muscles that might participate in a movement. There are many ways to do it well, and the best combination of muscles for one person might be unsuitable for another person.

- Myofibrils are made up of thick and thin filaments that lie alongside each other and overlap and are divided into units called sarcomeres. These thick and thin filaments are twisted strands of molecules that create contractions. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=804))

**Les rôles des spindles dans les mouvements :**
- In most situations, flexibility is not determined by the actual physical length of your muscle or of your muscle fibers that compose that muscle. The resting length of your muscle, its tone, and the amount it will lengthen are all the result of the communication between your spindle, your central nervous system, and the extrafusal fibers in your muscle. This communication creates patterns in your nervous system based on previous experiences regarding what is appropriate, safe, and functional.

- The strength of a muscle is dependent on its physical properties, including the actual number of muscle fibers. Muscle strength is also a product of the way that your nervous system recruits fibers and organizes your surrounding muscles and kinetic chains. When your nervous system is inefficient in the way it recruits and organizes muscles, it diminishes the functional strength of a muscle by creating a situation in which your muscle has to exert effort to overcome resistance from other muscles in the body. Increasing flexibility and strength is a process of reeducating your nervous system through conscious attention and practice as much as it is about stretching and repetitions.

### Les profondeurs de muscles et le nombre d'insertions 
- The deeper the layer of muscle or muscle tissue, the shorter it is (with a few exceptions). The shortest, deepest layers of muscle that cross one joint are called monoarticular, or one-joint muscles. These one-joint muscles perform specific actions and support articulation and discrimination at each joint. They are essential for the integrity and alignment of individual joints.

- These longer muscles are called multi-joint muscles if they cross two or more joints. The multi-joint muscles connect all the parts of your limbs, and they integrate your limbs into your torso. They give us the ability to negotiate large shifts of weight and movement of our whole body through space. In the diaphragm, they coordinate sophisticated shape changes in our torso.
