## La différence entre émotions et pensées
C'est simplement une question de temporalité 
- The way you think is the way you feel, but thought and feeling seem to be different in your experience. Why is this so? Because thought has a certain clarity, a certain agility about it. Emotion is slower. Today, you think this is a very wonderful person and you have warm feelings about him. Suddenly, he does something that you don’t like, and you think he is horrible. Your thought tells you he is horrible, but your emotion cannot change immediately. It struggles. If it is sweet now, it cannot turn bitter at the very next moment. It takes time to turn around. It has a wider turning arc. Depending on the strength of your emotion, maybe it will take three days or three months or three years, but after some time, it will turn around.

- It is not useful to create this conflict between head and heart. Emotion is just the juicier part of thought. ([Location 2465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=2465))
- It is best not to create polarities within yourself. That makes for civil war and schizophrenia. Thought and feeling are not different. One is dry. Another is juicy. Enjoy both. ([Location 2473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01B0K98D8&location=2473))
