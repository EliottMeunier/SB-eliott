## On ne peut pas décrire le non duel avec des mots et on ne peut pas décrire le prana en le prenant pour le non duel
**En résumé, cette note dit ça :** 
- In short, there is nondual or absolute truth, and there is relative or
  conventional truth, and one simply cannot take an assertion of the latter
  and apply it to the former. When we use finite words to try to represent
  ultimate Suchness, the most we get is poetic metaphor (or metaphoric
  statements), but the absolute is known only by a direct realization
  involving a transformation in consciousness (satori, sahaj, metanoia),
  and “what” is seen in satori cannot be stated in ordinary dualistic words,
  other than metaphors, poetry, and hints (if you want to know God, you
  must awaken, not merely theorize). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdykag3xdkexset9dra6y4d))

**Le raisonnement est celui-ci :** 
- In the final analysis, the traditions are very clear that the “first step” in
  involutionary manifestation is indeed a nondual Mystery and cannot in
  any way be adequately captured (or even hinted at) by conventional
  truth, including any sort of science, leading-edge or otherwise. The
  reason is that the great traditions from Parmenides to Padmasambhava
  are unanimous in what Vedanta calls the **“two truths” doctrine**: namely,
  there exists absolute or nondual truth, and relative or conventional truth,
  and they are of radically different orders. Relative truth is concerned
  with states of affairs in the finite realm, such as “water molecules
  contain one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms,” or “the Earth is 93
  million miles from the Sun,” or “the quantum vacuum potential in one
  angstrom of space is equal to 102300000 ergs,” and so on. According to
  Nagarjuna, Shankara, and Plotinus, you can make definite true or false
  statements about such finite events, and truth in the relative realm is
  indeed a search for those conditions under which relative assertions are
  true. This is relative, finite, or assertoric truth. 
  Not so absolute truth, about which literally and radically NOTHING
  may be accurately said in a noncontradictory fashion (including that
  one; if that statement is true, it is false). The great transcendental
  dialecticians—from Nagarjuna to Kant—have thoroughly demolished
  any such attempts, showing that every single one of the attempts to
  categorize ultimate reality (as, for example, by saying it is a quantum
  energy potential) turns on itself and dissolves in ad absurdum or ad
  infinitum regresses. They are not saying that Spirit does not exist, but
  simply that any finite statement about the infinite will categorically not
  work—not in the same way that statements about relative or
  conventional truth will work. Spirit can be known, but not said; seen, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdycszjbmbpa1b1b9fpwx2h))
- but not spoken; pointed out, but not described; realized, but not
  reiterated. Conventional truths are known by science; absolute truth is
  known by satori. They simply are not the same thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdyd104bn0qpdhdja8tbsbc))

- Even to call Brahman “infinite” is to miss the point entirely, since the word “infinite” only has meaning by virtue of its
  opposite (“finite”), and therefore even statements like “formless, empty,
  infinite, unqualifiable, nondual” are actually dualistic to the core. Zen
  tries to hint at this by saying that the absolute is “not two, not one.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdypwnqr5cbkd9369ptzkz4))

- The vacuum potential, then, is part of the relative, finite, manifest
  realm. For just that reason, it can be studied by science.
  It is a reality that, in at least some ways, is apart from other realities; it has qualities; it has quantities; it has dimensions. None of those statements can be predicated of Suchness, in any way other than poetic metaphors.
  However, precisely because the etheric, astral, and psychic fields are
  indeed part of the manifest realm, they are the proper object of study of
  science. No contradiction is involved in saying that the quantum
  vacuum is the protrusion into the gross realm of its immediate senior,
  implicate order: namely, prana. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdyv5rr93aqymqcdc6ny0rf)


- Following the great philosopher-sages (such as Nagarjuna, Plotinus, and Shankara), we can summarize the reasons that any sort of quantum or subquantum events are not Spirit: 
  1. Any quantum reality has some sort of characteristics, qualities, or
  dimensions that set it apart from manifest matter; but Spirit is
  radically shunya of drsti (empty of any and all qualities, including
  that characterization itself)—e.g., quantum vacuum has vast energy,
  spirit is unqualifiable. 
  2. Any quantum reality is different in some important ways from gross
  matter; but Spirit is not different from any manifestation, but is
  rather the Suchness or Isness of whatever arises. 
  3. Quantum reality has an opposite (e.g., non-quantum reality), but
  Spirit is radically nondual. 
  4. Spirit is dimensionless; quantum reality is merely in a different
  dimension. 
  5. And, most important, quantum material energy comes directly out of
  prana, not out of spirit (i.e., matter crystallizes out of spirit-as-prana,
  not spirit-as-spirit). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grdyx3v8y55fpxbrytzwj88f))
- Gross mass-energy is a surface manifestation of etheric fields, which are surface to astral-psychic fields, which are surface to causal, which is the mysterious first film on spirit’s Original Face as it manifests a world, moment to moment to moment….
