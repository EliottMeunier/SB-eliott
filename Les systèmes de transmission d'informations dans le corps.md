## Les systèmes de transmission d'informations dans le corps

In the **endocrine system**, cells create molecular signals that travel in the bloodstream to carry messages throughout the body. 

In the **immune system**, immune cells themselves (and the signaling molecules they create) travel through the body, communicating with different tissues and organs.  [[3 GARDEN/Notes/NEUROSCIENCES]]

In the **nervous system**, the cells have grown into networks that create specific and targeted communication over great distances as well as complex multilayered communication in central areas. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=1133))
- We have a variety of ways to look at the nervous system: 
	- By location: central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, or enteric nervous system 
	- By function: sensing, processing, and motoring 
	- By results: somatic, autonomic (including sympathetic and parasympathetic), or enteric ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0998616FH&location=1352))

- Synapses are described as **having plasticity, which means their signals are strengthened or weakened in response to how much they are used**. This plasticity can happen quickly (milliseconds to minutes) or over a more extended time (minutes to hours) and creates positive and negative feedback loops that can encourage or inhibit patterns of activity. The plasticity of our synapses plays an essential role in our ability to learn, change, adapt, and create memories. It is also key to understanding why our responses to the same activity can change over time as well as vary from person to person.
